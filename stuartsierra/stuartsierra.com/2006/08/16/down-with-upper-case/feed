		<description><![CDATA[James Says: &lt;em&gt;&quot;I would die if the keyboard was a dumbed-down single input for text.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;

So would I.  I&#039;m thinking longer term here.  When we have voice recognition, eye tracking, thin flexible displays, touch screens, and intelligent interfaces, I think CTRL and ALT will seem about as crude as a manual typewriter.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Interfaces are a contextual thing and IMO, vary greatly with the task one is performing. Since computers are capable of so many different functions, it&#039;s apparent that they have many contexts that require different interfaces.

For example, working with Photoshop I use my wacom tablet in one hand and my other hand to type in hotkeys with the keyboard. In many games, I sometimes only need to use my mouse. As a programmer though, I hate having to use anything but my keyboard.

The problem for me is that switching contexts takes time. Many of the keys on a keyboard are there to save programmers and hard-core computer users time. The CTRL and ALT keys especially, but not exclusively -- the home and end keys are useful in many non-modal editors. I still use pageup/pagedown for scolling text in editors and even browsers when I&#039;m looking up something quickly. Even &quot;Print Screen&quot; is handy for taking quick screen caps.

IMO, the modern keyboard is useful because of its evolution. I would die if the keyboard was a dumbed-down single input for text. It&#039;s already the most used interface on my desk. I only use my other interfaces for rather specific contexts.

Large interfaces with so many choices may be confusing for new users or users with specific use-contexts, but in the long run... choice is good for everyone.]]></description>
