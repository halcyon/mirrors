		<description><![CDATA[Ha! Hello, Matt. I&#039;d actually forgotten about this post. I&#039;ve learned a lot more since then, though, enough to make me think that this is largely a pipe dream. In order to be useful, a user interface has to conform to a mental model of the operations it enables. Developing such mental models is incredibly difficult, creative work, not something that can be automated. Pick any web app: would you rather work with it through a generic CRUD interface or an interface specific to the application?

That&#039;s not to say we can&#039;t make the GUI designer&#039;s job easier by providing more abstractions around interfaces and better languages to describe their semantic meaning. Various web technologies show some hopeful glimmers of this approach.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yes! Yes! Why hasn&#039;t this idea caught on? Even user interfaces developed with current web app frameworks aren&#039;t usually this abstract, except for cookie-cutter stuff like Rails scaffolding which is only meant for prototyping.

A UI framework this abstract could even break away from the assumption, inherent in every GUI toolkit I&#039;ve ever seen, that the user interface is visual. Think about what this would mean for accessibility for blind users. For that matter, an abstract UI framework like this would also make it much easier for blind programmers to develop presentable user interfaces for their apps.

Stuart, have you thought any more about this idea in the 6 years since you wrote this post?]]></description>
