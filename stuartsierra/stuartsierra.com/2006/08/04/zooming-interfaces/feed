		<description><![CDATA[I agree. I really like the concept of zooming interfaces. However, the introduction to the first demo states that you would normally use right/left click to zoom in and out. How would that translate for the world of Mac (unless you purchase the 2-button mouse)?

Also, it seems very easy to get lost navigating in and out all over the page. Makes me a little dizzy almost. Granted, it&#039;s much faster than waiting for a new window to open, and much better than those times when you find out the link WON&#039;T open. You can be certain the information will be there with zooming interfaces. But, it still strikes me as an idea that&#039;s not quite finished yet. What if each document (or pic, or piece of data, or new page, etc) had it&#039;s OWN zoom option? Instead of the entire page moving forward, what if each individual part zoomed in/out when clicked on, while the rest of the page stayed stationary? For instance: Let&#039;s say there&#039;s a page of pictures. You could click on one picture to zoom in, but the rest would remain the same size behind it; until you zoomed in on them. 

As for the Dasher concept. I think that&#039;s brilliant. I especially appreciate that the program learns the common words of the user as it goes. After working for several years with people of all different disabilities, I&#039;ve come to understand the necessity of something like this for people who have great things to say, but don&#039;t have the luxury of easy communication. 
I don&#039;t quite understand the idea of the multiple colors behind the words/letters. But I suppose everyone remembers their letters differently. And I have heard that some people associate different letters with different colors. That&#039;s merely a guess though.  
All in all, as stated in the Dasher explanation, I can imagine that the program probablly really is &quot;just like learning to drive a car&quot;. Which isn&#039;t bad at all. It could be learned quickly and easily, and to the benefit of many, many people. 

Thoughts?]]></description>
