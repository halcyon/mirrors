		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m new to Lisp, well kinda anyway, and I couldn&#039;t agree with you more. The lack of generality in certain areas of Common Lisp is the only thing that has bothered me, might just be me not being used to Common Lisp. I hope that someone will make this possible, or maybe I will be able to do it when I know Common Lisp a little better. Awsome post!]]></description>
