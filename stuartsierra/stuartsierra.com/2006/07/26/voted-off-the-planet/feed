		<description><![CDATA[... obviously Perl community is nicer :)
Those who visited http://www.perlmonks.org know for sure.

On the other hand, those people who do bridges between languages are doing very important jobs (not only from technical point of view!)

So, I consider your addition as very helpful.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[[...] To clarify for some respondants to Voted Off the Planet: As far as I know, the decision to remove my blog from Planet Lisp was not made collectively by readers but solely by the site&#8217;s maintainer. As is apparent from comments on the announcement, some people approved of the decision and some did not, but those comments came after it had already been done.

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt;I wonder if that’s a record of some kind?&lt;/i&gt;

To my knowledge, you are the first to be voted off.

&lt;i&gt;I’m just trying to learn things, and one of the ways I do that is by writing out explanations as if I’m teaching myself. Publishing them on the web is the fastest way to find out where I’ve made mistakes.&lt;/i&gt;
