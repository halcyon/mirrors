		<description><![CDATA[While I can&#039;t claim to have excelled at (or even acclimated to) the idea, I picked up a great-sounding mantra from a recent software engineering class: make the simplest thing that could possibly work.

Yes, yes...  but what about the library that could generalize this solution to all sorts of other tasks?  Wouldn&#039;t that be simpler in the long run?

No, no.  It just won&#039;t be, and exactly for the reason you described.  The only way to responsibly leverage your code-hours across many different projects is to map ALL projects out to ensure that no fatal flaws exist.

So what&#039;s easier?  If you can&#039;t make it simple enough, then use someone else&#039;s library.  Also from that class: one sure-fire way to become a super-programmer is to reuse code.  Reusing code isn&#039;t trivial - you may still spend 3 days - but it reduces the complexity of the problem.  

Coding a library AND software to use it is attacking one problem from two sides.  &quot;Shoe-horning&quot; an existing library into your software produces a better-defined problem, so hopefully a proper solution is forthcoming.]]></description>
