		<description><![CDATA[Ugh.  Thanks for this.  Had to google to figure out why the hell my log entries weren&#039;t coming out, despite a hundred lines of debugging output.

Fine-grained control over per-handler error levels is fine, but at the very least they should default them to ALL.  In other words, don&#039;t turn the extra filtering on unless I tell you to.  Defaulting to INFO in the absence of any other information is just irritating.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t think this is a mess, since you may even use different Loggers with the same handler (e.g. printing to Console) and therefore it is often usefull
to set the log level for the Loggers and the Handlers... so you can disable one Logger at runtime but others are still able to send messages to the handlers...]]></description>
