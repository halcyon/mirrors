		<description><![CDATA[Joseph- The point of the &quot;Hello World&quot; example is not to compare ClojureScript to JavaScript, but to compare ClojureScript &lt;em&gt;with the Google Closure Libraries&lt;/em&gt; to JavaScript &lt;em&gt;with a common library such as jQuery&lt;/em&gt;. I was addressing Elise Huard&#039;s complaint (later retracted) that using ClojureScript forces you to include all of the Google Closure Libraries in your application.

The smallest possible download size for a JavaScript program &lt;em&gt;using jQuery&lt;/em&gt; is 32K. The Google Closure Libraries, uncompressed, are many megabytes in size, but anything you don&#039;t use will be eliminated from the application download. 

The &quot;Hello World&quot; program in ClojureScript contains a lot of code besides just &quot;Hello World,&quot; mostly because the ClojureScript compiler is emitting that code in such a way that the Google Closure Compiler has trouble optimizing it. So right now, the smallest ClojureScript program compiles to about 18K. I am hopeful that the ClojureScript compiler will improve to take better advantage of the Google Closure Compiler&#039;s optimizations, thereby shrinking the size of the average compiled ClojureScript program.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;jQuery 1.7.2 is 33K, minified and gzipped. Caching doesn’t always save you. “Hello World” in ClojureScript, optimized and gzipped, is 18K&quot;

I&#039;m confused by this point. Are you comparing the file size of &quot;Hello world&quot; and jQuery?
If you are that does not seem like a very fair comparison, jQuery has a little more functionality than &#039;hello world&#039;. Comparing a ClojureScript file mirroring the functionality of jQuery and comparing would be a fairer comparison. 

Or saying:

Hello World in Clojurescript is 18K. Hello World in javascript is 22 bytes.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great to read a thoughtful analysis of “JavaScript versus language X”. What do you miss most when programming in the large in JavaScript? Note that a module system such as [1] is very helpful here.
