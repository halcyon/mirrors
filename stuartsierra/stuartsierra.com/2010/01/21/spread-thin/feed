		<description><![CDATA[&quot;Better yet, I wish sites like Github offered subdomain hosting, e.g. github.clojure.org.&quot;

Is that a tongue-in-cheek statement? &lt;a href=&quot;http://pages.github.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;GitHub does actually provide hosting&lt;/a&gt;, but I&#039;m not sure if it&#039;d help this problem.

I for one am really glad of blogs like Disclojure.org, which neatly summarizes &lt;em&gt;daily&lt;/em&gt; what Clojure people have done on blogs, the Google group, libraries, and events.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Stuart,

This is exactly what I am trying to do with disclojure.org, trying to become the go-to website for news on clojure. It is not an aggregator, because that would bury good information amongst less meaningful posts. Instead, the news are filtered and edited so that every day you can get only the most relevant ones (with some context to boot).

Sorry for the shameless plug...]]></description>
