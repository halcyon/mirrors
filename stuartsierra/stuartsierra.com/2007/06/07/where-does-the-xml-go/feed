		<description><![CDATA[Leonard Richardson Says: &lt;em&gt;&quot;It sounds like defining a &#039;footnote&#039; class for DIV should solve your problem.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;

I&#039;d like to do that, but I couldn&#039;t come up with a general-purpose representation for footnotes in HTML.  What&#039;s the best way to do it, anyway?  Put them at the bottom of a section with internal links (what I do now)?  JavaScript popups?  Margin notes?  Any one of these is more than I can accomplish with a simple DIV and CSS.  Maybe some JavaScript rewriting could do it, but I&#039;m not much of a JS hacker.  So I took the complicated route and made my own FOOTNOTE tag that gets used twice&#8212;once for the linked reference, once for the footnote itself&#8212;when the page is displayed.]]></description>
