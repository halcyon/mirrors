		<description><![CDATA[I have similar issues with one of my core products.

I first starting using ferret too, but one morning the index files it builds started to grow tremendously without rhyme or reason, maxing out hd space. I switched everything over to solr that day and it&#039;s been a solid performer for over a year now. Very fast when you know how to talk to the solr server.

The acts_as_solr plugin (at least early versions of it) were naive implementations. I&#039;ve branched my own version where I can delay commits to the solr db in order to make it fast for large updates as well. For searching, I query the solr server to return strictly ids, then query the db with those. That way not a terrible amount of data is being traded. Also, you have to make sure that documents deleted from the db also get deleted from the solr index. 

For batch updates/uploads to the db, check out http://agilewebdevelopment.com/plugins/ar_extensions . It has a batch import function that you can also get to work to update records with unique keys. I had huge huge huge performance gains when using this plugin. 

Sorry I can&#039;t help you with the best way to store all of the text in general. I keep newspaper articles just fine in mysql. I&#039;m sure there&#039;s a way. Lexis Nexis does it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Sorry, I didn&#039;t read this entry closely enough. I hadn&#039;t heard of Solr but that sounds like the best choice for indexing. For storage I&#039;d keep the data in whatever format it fits in naturally (probably flat files, but maybe database tables) and keep all the standardized metadata in the Solr index.

Not sure if this will help either, but there you go.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You&#039;ve basically described Lucene, the library of which Ferret is a port. I don&#039;t know of any other library for searching structured text, though I think PyLucene is more mature than Ferret. However the last time I seriously looked into this was around 2005.]]></description>
