		<description><![CDATA[Chris Nielsen Said: &lt;em&gt;Fame does have it’s price, but perhaps you were seeing an email assault that was cause by the frustrating lack of a contact form or email address on the altlaw.org site…?&lt;/em&gt;

Sorry about that -- we just got our new dedicated server and I haven&#039;t had time to configure postfix yet.  There will be a contact page, I promise.  In the mean time, I&#039;m glad your message reached me here!

		<description><![CDATA[Fame does have it&#039;s price, but perhaps you were seeing an email assault that was cause by the frustrating lack of a contact form or email address on the altlaw.org site...?

I did think about sending my email message to every possible name at the domain, but I opted instead to use the &quot;hidden&quot; email address in the domain whois record, and along with the suspenders also use a belt in the form of a Google search which led me to a blog where I could leave a comment.... Yay!

I&#039;m VERY excited about altlaw.org and my email is just to let you know and to offer some help if you need any... with any luck someone will get the email.

Thanks,
Chris]]></description>
