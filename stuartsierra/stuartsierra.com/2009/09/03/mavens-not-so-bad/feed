		<description><![CDATA[Sonatype has been experimenting with alternatives to a xml based pom.  They demonstrate a yaml based pom in this blog post: http://www.sonatype.com/people/2009/11/maven-3x-paving-the-desire-lines-part-two/  From my understanding, extending maven to read its pom from a different representation should not be too hard to do.

Then again, the m2eclipse project has a great pom editor, which for a large number of projects eliminates the need to look at the xml underneath.]]></description>

Yes, you could use any XML generator. Clojure has several, including an &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/antoniogarrote/clj-haml/tree/master&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;implementation of Haml&lt;/a&gt; and my own &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/richhickey/clojure-contrib/blob/master/src/clojure/contrib/prxml.clj#L142&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;prxml&lt;/a&gt;.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Very enlightening post!
I&#039;d always been turned off by maven but now I&#039;m going to give it a closer look.
As an aside, using an xml templating engine like Haml might make editing the pom files
even more palatable.
for eg. in jruby,
%foo
  %bars
     %bar &#039;baz&#039;
Is much more pleasant to work with if you have an xml allergy as I do.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for posting this! I&#039;m glad to see such a clear explanation; I think a lot of people have preconceived notions about Maven that lead them to discount it without really understanding it. I&#039;ve had a lot of luck depending on the clojure-pom parent mentioned above for my projects; it lets you end up with about a third as much XML as your sample. But it&#039;s good to start at the basics.]]></description>
