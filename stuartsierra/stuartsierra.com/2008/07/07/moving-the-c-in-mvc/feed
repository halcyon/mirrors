		<description><![CDATA[&quot;the totally seo-hostile, inaccessible-without-js overkill variant...&quot;
Remember guys, this is for pseudo-desktop apps so I don&#039;t really want it to be accessible. 
I also don&#039;t think it&#039;s bad to require js. AND css. they are open standards and built into browsers.
All you have to do is add some  content and let the users know what&#039;s going on.

I&#039;d like to see some sort of sproutcore/merb hybred.

		<description><![CDATA[This is exactly the model I am developing my current application with, its a perfect fit for us, 

The diagram might be misleading, in the case of couchdb where its possible to implement business rules inside the database its fine, but in the case of most databases, a scripting langauge still sits in front and handles all the REST calls, the web server simply serves static html / js / css / images, and javascript is used to populate any dynamic
data, which are served as REST calls. 

The major problem with this is that as mentioned it completely ruins accessibility, for applications that dont really mind about google and deep links dont make sense its fine, it works very well together with a distributed backends such as ec2 / slicehost. but that doesnt fit for a most web applications. Its something ive been trying to get my head around, but havent come up with a nice solution as of yet.]]></description>
