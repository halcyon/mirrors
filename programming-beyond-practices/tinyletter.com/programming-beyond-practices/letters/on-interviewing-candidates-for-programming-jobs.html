        <div class="message-body"> Hello Developer Friend!<br>
<br>
I get asked about interviews a lot, both from people applying for jobs, and people trying to hire others for jobs. I usually tend to duck this question because of complicated feelings about the whole thing, but yet it keeps coming up on an almost weekly basis. So it&#39;s clearly a question people care a lot about!<br>
<br>
Below you&#39;ll find a rough brain dump I had sent to one of the readers of this newsletter. Hopefully you will find it interesting, no matter which side of the table you&#39;re on.<br>
<br>
In truth, my response isn&#39;t so much about how to conduct an interview, but instead &quot;how to position yourself to attract the right kind of applicant in the first place.&quot; And that to me is the problem that many businesses fail to solve.<br>
<br>
I&#39;d love to hear more questions or ideas on what I&#39;ve shared below, to help me focus my own thoughts. Please do get in touch if you want to talk more, and enjoy the mini-rant.<br>
&nbsp;
<hr><br>
<strong>The short answer I have for you is that I don&#39;t think interviews are an effective way to screen candidates, no matter what the context is.</strong><br>
<br>
That said, I think the following things are positive indicators:<br>
<br>
- A meaningful portfolio of work, whether it&#39;s professional or personal.<br>
- Ability to talk through and ask good questions about realistic problems in whatever business domain your company is in.<br>
- Sufficient communication skills and technical competence to explain some code they&#39;ve written, at both the high level and at the detailed level.<br>
- A mindset that emphasizes customer service and a focus on business outcomes rather than raw technical interests.<br>
<br>
From there, it&#39;s totally going to depend on how supportive your environment is. If you have experienced developers who are able to train newcomers and have enough capacity to make that happen, then I&#39;d hire purely for &quot;good mindset and demonstrated ability to learn quickly&quot; -- de-emphasizing existing skills.<br>
<br>
If you&#39;re in a workplace that will allow someone a good amount of time to ramp up, but won&#39;t be able to provide much mentoring, then you want to look for someone who has a demonstrated ability to self-study and decent self-management skills as well.<br>
<br>
If you need someone to hit the ground running on a practical project, then you need to look very closely at how their existing work and portfolio maps to your needs. Then you can craft any interviews around talking through real business problems similar to what you expect the person will be working on, and screen out anyone who doesn&#39;t seem to know where to start.<br>
<br>
It&#39;s very important to take an outside view of all of the above too: Plenty of orgs may think they have the capacity and experience to teach, but if that hasn&#39;t already happened successfully several times, it&#39;s a sign of excess confidence.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Plenty of orgs may think they have available capacity, but if there&#39;s any overtime work being done at any point in time, or frequent churn of incomplete WIP, it&#39;s a sign that the capacity just isn&#39;t there. So rather than going with a gut feeling on this, it&#39;s good to look at the history of the org and see how it maps to reality.<br>
<br>
From there, we get back to the point I made earlier... I don&#39;t think interviews are a good way to screen candidates: they&#39;ve very wasteful and generate tons of false positives and negatives for both the candidates and the business doing the hiring.<br>
<br>
So assuming you can&#39;t do away with the process entirely (i.e. hire directly by referral or contract-to-hire), then the question becomes &quot;how do we get the right people in the door in the first place to take an interview,&quot; and &quot;how do we get the candidates that won&#39;t work out in our organization to not apply at all?&quot;<br>
<br>
From here: It&#39;s largely a sales and marketing process! Or put in less narrowly commercial terms, it&#39;s about making connections with people in the places they&#39;re already spending their time, in a way that provides value to them... both online and offline.<br>
<br>
This part isn&#39;t rocket science, but it&#39;s hard work and you have to make sure to avoid making it transactional -- that kills good will and won&#39;t yield good outcomes:<br>
<br>
<em>Go to or host your own meetups, write blog posts, share good stuff on social media. Build free tools and give them away. Contribute to open source. Sponsor events. Speak at events. The list is infinite but it boils done to providing value to others while remaining visible; all the same things we ask job-seekers to do should also be done by employers!</em><br>
<br>
Invest much more time and money in this than you think is reasonable, and do it from a position of sincerity.<br>
<br>
Pay attention to all of these issues in the context of both the technical skills you&#39;re looking for as well as the problem domain you are working in.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Whatever you project into the world about your business, that&#39;s what you&#39;ll ultimately attract as applicants. There are ten thousand methods for cutting out the noise, but more time spent on finding the signal will go a long way.<br>
<br>
In the end, you should be answering the question &quot;Why would the people who would benefit our business even WANT to work for us?&quot; -- If that answer is clear before the interview even happens, that will make a huge difference.<br> </div>
