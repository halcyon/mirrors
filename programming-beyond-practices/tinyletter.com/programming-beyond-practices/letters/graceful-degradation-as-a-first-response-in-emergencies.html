        <div class="message-body"> <div>A few days ago, I asked you to work through a thought experiment that was meant to simulate a minor emergency situation.&nbsp;Here&#39;s a quick recap of the scenario, in case you missed the last email or need a reminder:</div>

<blockquote>
<div>You&#39;re building a website&nbsp;that&nbsp;helps people find nearby yard sales. The site&nbsp;gets mentioned in very popular newsletter, and suddenly there is a huge increase in traffic.&nbsp;This unexpected surge of requests causes&nbsp;a server-side reverse geocoding operation to fail, which in turn results in all visits to the site&#39;s homepage failing with a 500 error.<br>
<br>
With a giant flood of exception reports coming in and a broken website, your goal is to get things back to a stable state as quickly as possible, hopefully in time to make sure that at least some of the visitors who are arriving via the newsletter link end up having a good first impression of the site.</div>
</blockquote>
The temptation is strong in this situation to think about how to fix what&#39;s broken: the reverse geocoding operation. Some teams would go farther than that -- jumping into the &quot;who&quot; and &quot;why&quot; of the problem to seek some sort of root cause before responding. None of this is helpful in a crisis situation. But thinking clearly under pressure isn&#39;t easy, so it happens often.<br>
<br>
Instead, a better question is &quot;what happens if we temporarily disable the broken piece of functionality?&quot; That question doesn&#39;t always yield great results, but in many cases it&#39;s the shortest path to getting a system up and running again.<br>
<br>
In this particular case, reverse geocoding was only in use to turn a lat/long coordinate back into a human readable place name to pre-fill a search box. Turning it off would mean that the visitors would still see a map centered on whatever location their IP/browser location services provided, but that the search box would be empty rather than showing the place name that the lat/long coordinates had resolved to.<br>
<br>
The worst case scenario? That the visitor would see a map showing a location they aren&#39;t familiar with or didn&#39;t actually want to see, then they&#39;d type their city/state into the search box and things would work as normal. In other words, the reverse geolocation feature was a matter of convenience and UX, not a core piece of functionality on the critical path. Disabling it would have minimal impact.<br>
<br>
Is there a risk in disabling functionality, particularly under pressure? Absolutely! But risk is relative, and a site that is completely down is already in about as bad of a state as it can get.<br>
<br>
If&nbsp;disabling the feature doesn&#39;t work... then you will have only lost a small amount of time and can go back to the drawing board.<br>
<br>
The next step would probably be even more coarse-grained efforts to get things back to a stable state, like throwing up a temporary page with a friendly apology to visitors and an invitation to come back again soon (bonus points for linking a social media account or including an email form). At a minimum, a temporary landing page would clearly communicate the status of the site, and it would also take the strain off of the overwhelmed resources: both the reverse geocoding API and the exception reporting system.<br>
<br>
The moment that things have stabilized, the conversation can begin about a proper fix. In this particular case, it&#39;s probably to move the reverse geocoding calls to the client side, which may even be a very easy change to make. But it&#39;s much better to find out the answer to that question<em> after&nbsp;you&#39;ve ended the state of emergency</em>, because then you&#39;ll be able to think and communicate much more clearly.<br>
<br>
Yes, this is an obvious and even quite a boring answer. But we often forget to default to graceful degradation in a crisis situation simply because it feels like a hack, or because we think that we have an idea for a real solution that will &quot;only take five minutes&quot; -- and that&#39;s where we get ourselves into trouble.<br>
<br>
If you&#39;re looking to get the most out of this exercise, here&#39;s another thing you can try:<br>
<br>
<strong>Take one project that you&#39;re currently maintaining, and then in a staging or development environment, introduce a breaking failure into one of its features. Then without &quot;fixing&quot; the broken feature, try to find a way to restore as much system functionality as possible by working around or hiding the problem with no more than 10-15 minutes of work.</strong><br>
<br>
If you repeat that exercise a few times, you may eventually come across some code that&#39;s hard to gracefully degrade, and that&#39;s a sign that you&#39;ve either identified some part of your system that is poorly designed, or that you&#39;ve identified a hot spot on the critical path of your application. In either case, it should provide you with some useful information about the overall health and safety of the systems you&#39;re maintaining.<br>
<br>
Hope you enjoyed this essay, and happy hacking!<br>
