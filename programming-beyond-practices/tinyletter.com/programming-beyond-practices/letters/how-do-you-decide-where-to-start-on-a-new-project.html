        <div class="message-body"> Suppose that you have an idea for a simple 2D video game, and you&#39;re thinking about working on it as a side project.<br>
<br>
You have some basic experience with a game engine in your favorite programming language, but it doesn&#39;t offer an&nbsp;easy way to package up&nbsp;games and deliver them to non-programmers. With a complicated set of dependencies, it&#39;s even hard to convince your programmer friends to install this framework just to play test your games.<br>
<br>
You think your game idea is pretty promising, and that it may be something that many others will enjoy. But you know that your audience will be severely limited if you stick to using the tool you&#39;re already comfortable with.<br>
<br>
You could switch game engines --&nbsp;but that would mean learning a new programming language, a new development tool chain, and a whole new set of APIs.<br>
<br>
You are not a complete novice in working with game development tools, but you&#39;re far from an expert. It&#39;ll most likely take you several weeks of practice on nights and weekends to make the switch to something new.<br>
<br>
You want to take the shortest path towards validating your game idea. Your goal is to invest as few hours as possible to get a rough sense of whether there is any interest at all in what you&#39;re trying to build.<br>
<br>
Assume that you have no money to invest whatsoever, and that you only have about 4 hours per week to work on this side project.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<strong>What do you do in the first week of the project? How about the first month?</strong><br>
<br>
I&#39;ll share my own ideas in the next few days, but I look forward to hearing yours as well.<br>
<br>
Have a nice weekend!<br>
