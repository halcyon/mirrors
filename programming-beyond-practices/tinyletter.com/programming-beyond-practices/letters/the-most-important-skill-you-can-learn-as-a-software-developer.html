        <div class="message-body"> A few years ago, I missed a flight (and the first night of a conference) because well...computers are terrible.<br>
<br>
I had gotten to the airport about 1.5 hours early: Not a huge amount of time to spare, but more than enough for a small, not-so-busy airport.<br>
<br>
I had already checked in online the night before, and all I needed to do was use one of those self-service kiosks to print out my boarding pass.<br>
<br>
I went to do that, and was happy to see there was no one using the machines. A few seconds later, I found out why: the system was offline and couldn&#39;t look up or print out passes. A sad &quot;See attendant&quot; message showed up, and so I got in line with everyone else to go to the check-in desk.<br>
<br>
The line moved slowly, but not so slow as to have me worried. The security checkpoint line wasn&#39;t very busy, and my gate was so close by that I could actually see it.<br>
<br>
But when I finally got to the check-in desk, I was told that they couldn&#39;t print me a pass, and that I&#39;d have to be on standby for another flight, many hours later. I tried to explain that I had plenty of time to get to my gate, but they wouldn&#39;t budge. They insisted that there was a strict cutoff at 45 minutes, and that they couldn&#39;t do anything to help.<br>
<br>
Eventually, the attendant explained to me that it was just how their system was built. There was no way, at least from the computers they were using, to print out a pass after the cutoff point had passed. It didn&#39;t matter that there were 43 minutes left, there was no way to override the software.<br>
<br>
Now, who knows if that was actually true. But my own career as a software developer tells me there is no reason why it couldn&#39;t be. Someone told a programmer to disable printouts at 45 minutes before a flight, the programmer implemented it, the code was shipped. A ticket in some sort of enterprisey hellscape of an issue tracker was probably closed.<br>
<br>
Maybe the airline bought this software from a third party vendor and couldn&#39;t fix the issue if they wanted to. Maybe they built it themselves and just didn&#39;t think things through. Or maybe they actually wanted to enforce the rules consistently with no exceptions. No matter what, the end result is a system that&#39;s pretty hostile to humans. It makes it so that the service agents have to treat customers poorly, even if they want to help them.<br>
<br>
Far too many software systems are like this.<br>
<br>
So what is the most essential skill for software developers? To practice empathy, and not just locally, but on a global, system-wide manner. It&#39;s hard, because it involves visualizing the entire value chain that exists between you and the people who end up feeling the effects of your software.<br>
<br>
With this in mind, I <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/empathy-the-key-to-a-successful-software-project">wrote an article on Empathy</a>&nbsp;for the O&#39;Reilly Ideas blog. It has a totally different backstory from this email, and I think you&#39;ll enjoy it.<br>
<br>
I&#39;d love to hear stories about how empathy plays a role in your own work (for better or worse), and I&#39;d be very thankful if you shared a link to the article and/or forwarded this email to others who might benefit from it.<br>
<br>
Looking forward to hearing from you!<br>
