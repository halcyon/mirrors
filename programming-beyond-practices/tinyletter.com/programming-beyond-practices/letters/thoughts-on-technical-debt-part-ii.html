        <div class="message-body"> <div>Hello Developer Friend!<br>
<br>
In the last email I sent out, I shared a small thought experiment to get you to explore the concepts of technical debt and technical over-investment.<br>
<br>
I received some awesome feedback on this exercise&nbsp;much sooner than I expected to,&nbsp;and I&#39;d like to share a summary of&nbsp;one&nbsp;reader&#39;s response&nbsp;before discussing my own answer&nbsp;later in the week.<br>
<br>
First, let&#39;s quickly restate the problem description, incase you missed yesterday&#39;s email or need a refresher...</div>

<blockquote>
<div>Suppose that there is a small report that you need to build that will help with medical scheduling in a legacy clinic management system.<br>
<br>
The report will verify that any new appointment book entries have a few pieces of useful metadata that is aggregated by a secondary reporting system.<br>
<br>
New appointment book entries are keyed in at least one year in advance, but the secondary reporting system only ever looks out six weeks into the future at any point in time.<br>
<br>
If the required metadata is missing from any records that show up in the secondary system, it is possible to spot the problem and fix it at that time, but each error takes up to a minute to fix and can potentially distract the scheduling manager whenever it happens.<br>
<br>
There is a clear benefit to resolving these errors before they show up in the secondary reporting system: By doing so, the person working with that system won&#39;t be pulled off task to correct minor data entry problems at seemingly random intervals.<br>
<br>
How should you go about solving this problem?</div>
</blockquote>

<div>I then asked you to choose between one of the following solutions, or if you felt that you weren&#39;t ready to make a decision, to come up with some questions that would help you evaluate the risks and rewards associated with each of the options:</div>

<blockquote>
<div>OPTION #1: &nbsp;Build a hastily thrown together auditing report which will be completely undocumented and untested. It will be run manually once every three months, and any errors in the system will be resolved in one large batch. This program will take you 30 minutes to write, and 2 minutes to run whenever the report is needed, plus however long it takes for you to get around to actually running it.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
OPTION #2: Build an automated system that sends out alerts whenever a new appointment book entry is added to the system without the required metadata, along with a weekly batch report that lists any entries that haven&#39;t been fixed yet. This program will take you six hours to write, and will deliver results automatically without the need for a human to run the process. However, an active monitoring system will need to be running at all times and configured correctly for this program to work. (You can assume clean code here, and enough test coverage and documentation to make the decently code maintainable)</div>
</blockquote>

<div>Only a few hours after sharing this exercise, I received a response that made a strong argument in favor of investing the six hours to build a robust solution that is clean, well documented, and tested.<br>
<br>
The person who shared this feedback&nbsp;listed out a number of assumptions that guided their decision making process:<br>
&nbsp;</div>

<ul>
	<li>Most software lives longer than you initially planned for, and so it may be the case that a second or even third maintainer will need to work with any code you&#39;re writing today, long after you&#39;re gone.<br>
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Software grows over time, and ought to become more mature as it grows. Earlier investments in code quality help make future code easier to write in a proper way, which helps keep overall system quality increasing over time.<br>
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Code written by one person in a half hour without regard for its quality might take much longer for someone else in the future to read, or even be difficult to understand for the person that wrote it if enough time passed.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

<div>So because of all of the above... it seems like as long as there is room in the budget, it makes sense to spend some extra time up front to prevent an unknown cost for the project in the future. From an engineering perspective, this is the responsible thing to do.<br>
<br>
I was super happy to receive this reply! In many contexts, the line of thinking expressed by this developer is exactly the sort of thing that will lead to mature, stable software and responsible development practices. But is it the best&nbsp;advice for t<em>his particular scenario</em>?&nbsp;What do you think?<br>
<br>
Go back and re-read this email if you need to... then imagine that the developer who&nbsp;shared this answer is someone on your team who has asked you to confirm their proposed plan of action.<br>
<br>
Are you convinced that they&#39;re headed down the right path? Why or why not? Or if you&#39;re simply not sure yet, what questions would you need answered in order to understand the problem&nbsp;better?<br>
