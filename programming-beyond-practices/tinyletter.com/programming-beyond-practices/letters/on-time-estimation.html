<p class="p1">Estimates are a tricky topic, because most programmers are simply not very good at them. There are even some folks (many of whom are quite smart) who strongly believe that we simply cannot give reliable estimates &mdash; which leads them to conclude that estimation is a form of waste.</p>

<p class="p3">Then there is another factor: What is called an estimate is often treated as a commitment or a promise. This can lead to many questionable practices: such as getting trapped in analysis paralysis in the hope of getting a high level of accuracy, or padding an estimate to an extreme degree to avoid going over</p>

<p class="p3">This is in part a communication problem, and in part a cultural problem. Starting by addressing the former is a necessary precondition for changing the latter. To do that, you need to ask the simple question: <b>Why am I being asked give estimates for my work?</b></p>

<p class="p3">The answer may be that it&#39;s simply a process control measure: That developers ought to be able to estimate work reliably because it shows they&#39;re capable of analyzing and understanding a problem before working on it. That&#39;s a mediocre reason.</p>

<p class="p3">A slightly better reason is to keep a budget under control. If a customers knows they have only 100 hours of time available to them in a month, they will measure the potential value of a feature or fix differently if it takes 5 hours vs 50 hours.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="p3">The customer does not (and cannot) estimate order of magnitude themselves, so they need help. But there are many ways to solve this problem, and task-by-task fine grained estimation may not be as useful as customers think they are. Be warned though: you need to prove a better solution exists and gain trust before other options will be considered.</p>

<p class="p3">But the real reason why most people ask for an estimate is because there is a perceived urgency of getting some work done by a particular date. This is in some cases a<b><i> real business need </i></b><i>&mdash; </i>for example, if you&rsquo;re making a promotional website that ties into the Super Bowl, delivering even a day late would destroy the value entirely. In other cases, the perceived urgency is either completely invalid or not worth as much as the customer thinks. You need to look at your situation to figure out which is which.</p>

<p class="p3">In this last case, when there is a genuine reason to deliver by a certain date, it is very important to communicate that development time is not calendar time! Five days of development work with ten days of delay for feedback and 15 days of delay for approval takes up 20 days of calendar time. Five days of development work broken up into ten half-day chunks will take much more than five days of calendar time, because of knowledge decay and context switching.</p>

<p class="p3">The worst thing is when a customer asks you for an estimate, and you give one based on development time&hellip; but they interpret it to mean calendar time. Unless you are crystal clear in setting expectations and discussing your schedule &mdash; you will be blamed for this. An uncomfortable truth, but one solvable by communicating more clearly.</p>

<p class="p3">I could go on forever, but I think I&rsquo;ll stop here for now. Curious to hear your thoughts!</p>
