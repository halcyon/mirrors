<br>
Choosing a starting point is especially tricky for side projects -- where your available time might be thin, your money to invest non-existent, and your problem space vaguely defined (if it is defined at all!)<br>
<br>
In my last email, I described the typical dilemma that might prevent you from working on a new side project in the first place: deciding whether to learn a new technical toolchain that will eventually be necessary to adopt if you want your project to be successful, or to start with what you know first so that you can quickly explore ideas.<br>
<br>
I asked you to imagine that you wanted to create a simple 2D game. The assumption was that you have some basic experience with a game library in your favorite programming language, but that particular toolset isn&#39;t practical for distributing games to non-programmers.<br>
<br>
If you dig into this problem a little bit, you&#39;ll find that the tension comes from having to bootstrap two distinct feedback loops, both of which are critically important.<br>
<br>
<strong>The first feedback loop is functional testing -- </strong>where you take ideas in your head and turn them into software that you can interact with. It doesn&#39;t need to be pretty; it could be a proof of concept or even a mockup. But the process of climbing down the ladder of abstraction is essential in order to know both what is possible and what is practical in a project. The speed at which you can translate a thought into running software is the limiting factor for how quickly you can learn a new problem domain.<br>
<br>
<strong>The second feedback loop is product testing</strong>&nbsp;-- where you consider questions like &quot;will people find this software interesting? Will they use it? Will they enjoy using it?&quot; It is said that no piece of software survives first contact with the user, and so doing this sort of testing early and often is essential, even in side projects. If you&#39;re the only user it just means eating your own dog food... otherwise, it means getting the work into the hands of the people you do want to use it as soon as possible.<br>
<br>
Coming back to our game example, suppose you decide to start with learning a new game framework first -- one that would let you produce games that non-programmers could easily either download or even play directly in their browser. If you&#39;re taking a very long-term view on things, this might be a reasonable approach: spend the time to learn the &quot;right tool for the job&quot;, get good enough at it to be comfortable, and then once you&#39;re ready, begin building the game you wanted to build in the first place, starting from a more stable foundation.<br>
<br>
In theory, there&#39;s nothing wrong with that way of doing things. In practice, I&#39;ve rarely seen it work out well, both in professional work and in hobby projects. Why? Because usually it ends up with someone learning a thing or two about a new tool, but then losing interest before they actually get to build something useful with that tool. Although there are exceptions to the rule, most programmers who go this route have hundreds of completed tutorials and example programs, but very few completed works they can call their own.<br>
<br>
At the other extreme, you might decide to build out your idea using the tools you know, and accept that it&#39;ll mostly be for your own personal amusement. Either that, or you&#39;ll assume that if you get far enough along with your ideas, you could always do a big rewrite down the line to make the software you built accessible to a broader audience.<br>
<br>
In this case, you get to move fast on your idea and stay comfortable, but you give up on the fast feedback loops that come with the feedback of a diverse userbase. If and when you decide to come up with a proper distribution plan, you&#39;ll inevitably deal with at least some problems along the way... some of which may prove to make the transition more trouble than it is worth.<br>
<br>
Neither of these outcomes are ideal. To get a better outcome, you need to look for a middle path.<br>
<br>
Rather than giving prescriptive advice on what approach to take here, I&#39;ve instead decided to try some ideas out myself, and share my progress as I go. So far, I&#39;ve completed the first week of working on a simple game project, and I plan to continue the experiment for at least another few more weeks.</span>

Pay full attention to the effort being put into navigating the two fundamental feedback loops, because that&#39;s the interesting part of the story. Feel free to mentally substitute your new web framework, your fancy devops tool, your testing library, or your cat picture uploader in place of my mediocre little game.</span></p>

<br>
The first thing I did was create a really minimal, barely interesting mockup of a game screen. It probably isn&#39;t even understandable without some explanation, but the basic premise is that it&#39;s a realtime puzzle game in which you manage robotic workers in a factory who move little widgets around from machine to machine.<br>
<br>
So for example, you might have your workers carry red and blue widgets to the input side of a machine, and then on the output side a purple widget will pop out, which will in turn be fed downstream to the rest of the factory for further processing:<br>
<img class="tl-email-image" data-id="635089" height="185" src="http://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/14b34a3094ef5360c8e0fb79cedae1d7d48a0c6d/images/d45c75fe-b20d-444d-aac5-f3e6abe10438.png" style="width: 640px; max-width: 640px;" width="640"><br>
Waving a magic wand, I can say to you &quot;Imagine this sort of thing, but with much more complicated action chains, and tight time constraints.&quot; I don&#39;t expect that will translate perfectly, but it might give you a rough idea of what I&#39;m trying to do here, and so this mockup defines a good starting point for an interactive demonstration. &nbsp;</span><br>
<br>
After showing the drawing to a few people and tweeting it, I was able to get a handful of people to express interest in the game. Not a lot mind you, but at least I knew that I&#39;d be able to share some more ideas with some folks as I worked and see what they thought of it. Some even mentioned games that might be similar enough to be worth looking at as a source of inspiration, and after checking those out, it was clear to me that at least some folks &quot;got&quot; what I was trying to do.<br>
<br>
My first temptation was to muddle through a proof of concept all in one big iteration. To set aside an afternoon and crank out something looking vaguely similar to the mockup, and see how people might respond to it. I would use the tool I was already familiar with and then make a video of my progress to share with others.<br>
<br>
Thirty minutes into my first day of working on the project, I realized that wasn&#39;t going to work out well. Games have an odd way of being easy to start on idea, but hard to get perfectly right, and by the time you layer in all the bits of extra logic and state and flow control that you need to get something working... you end up with a tangled mess of bad code. Or at least, as a very inexperienced game developer, that&#39;s where I end up.<br>
<br>
In the back of my mind, I already had decided that what I wanted to do was get this first example running as quickly as possible, and then once it was done, I&#39;d work to port it to a new toolchain that might make it possible to get my game in the hands of real users. I had thought that the scope was small enough, but was quickly proven wrong.<br>
<br>
Realizing this, I came up with a different strategy: Rather than hacking together a messy prototype all in one go, I&#39;d instead try to proceed by working from the bottom up. This lead me to work on isolated sub-experiments that could be completed in 20-30 minute increments -- all of which would take me a little closer to having all the necessary building blocks to produce my proof of concept game level.<br>
<br>
For fun and to keep trying to attract a bit of interest from my programmer friends, I created a Twitter account where I posted these experiments daily as I worked on the game. You can click the image below to see a YouTube playlist of all of them, but the screenshot shows you just how simplistic and bite-sized they really were:<br>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZW6Q53sLZw&amp;list=PL8T8CeEVWRsKq2mgwJVX1MYVZzsEQWj2A" style="font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;" target="_blank"><img class="tl-email-image" data-id="635021" height="460" src="http://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/14b34a3094ef5360c8e0fb79cedae1d7d48a0c6d/images/f34939f5-40ef-4bd2-a5a1-31dc0237d35d.png" style="font-size: 16px; outline-color: rgb(236, 33, 38); width: 640px; max-width: 640px;" width="640"></a><br>
In doing these experiments, I started to untangle some of the annoying headaches of turning an idea in my head into running code. For example, it wasn&#39;t clear at all from the mockup image that setting up automated paths for workers would be somewhat complicated technically, because I didn&#39;t think about that at all when building the mockup. With my game depending on fast worker placement and having a constantly ticking countdown clock, you need a smooth (if not beautiful) UI for this, and it took me a lot of effort to come up with one.<br>
<br>
There were also a few basic technical issues to overcome: For example, I had naively assumed that drawing a line in my game framework of choice would be as simple as specifying two points and a thickness, but it turned out to be somewhat more complicated than that.<br>
<br>
With very little documentation and my own experiences lacking, it took me some tedious experimentation to discover that in order to get a line with a consistent thickness regardless of its angle relative to the origin, that I&#39;d have to <strong>(insert tedious math explanation here)</strong>, and so that soaked up a good portion of my time.<br>
<br>
Although these problems were annoying, they felt validating in a way. Had I started by working with a&nbsp;toolchain I wasn&#39;t familiar with, I would not have gotten nearly far enough in the same amount of time, and so I wouldn&#39;t be thinking about things like the worker placement UI until much later down the line.<br>
<br>
Just as the line drawing problem is an example of the kind of rabbit hole you go down when you&#39;re unfamiliar with how a particular feature works in a library ... I&#39;d be facing a thousand rabbit holes if I were using a whole new tech stack.<br>
<br>
After all of my experimentation, I ended up with a codebase that I wouldn&#39;t exactly call clean, but it was much more coherent than it would have been had I attempted to do everything at once. Whenever I hit a dead end, a new tightly scoped experiment helped me refine my understanding, and then I&#39;d bake the gained knowledge back into the codebase.<br>
<br>
All this effort made it relatively easy to put together the demo level once I finally had the core building blocks in place. Click below to see it in action, or simply imagine little yellow balls whizzing around, picking up red and blue balls, which turn into purple balls, all while a timer frantically counts down to an arbitrary deadline.<br>
<br>

<span style="color: rgb(85, 85, 85); font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 24px;">​What you&#39;re looking at here is roughly six hours of development work, which is a somewhat realistic amount of time to spend on a side project in a single week (if slightly on the high side for me).<br>
<br>
I am happy with the result, because it takes my original mockup and turns it into something real, and because now that I have some raw materials built I can think of lots more that can be done to make the game more interesting and attractive at this point.<br>
<br>
Most importantly, the approach of building things bottom up has a very important benefit that I haven&#39;t mentioned yet: It can serve as a roadmap of where to start once I begin trying to learn a new game framework. Having these microscopic examples will make it possible for me to start very small, and also tell me what I should focus on and what I can ignore when learning new technical tooling.<br>
<br>
In other words, rather than trying to port the full level all at once, I can start with simple things like &quot;Put a red dot and a blue dot on the screen, then delete them and replace with a purple dot&quot;... and then compare the code I already wrote to do that with whatever I end up writing with the new toolchain. I will be able to use my progress (or lack of progress) on working my way through these experiments to give me a sense of how feasible it will be to learn a new system in a reasonable amount of time.<br>
<br>
For the first week of work on this project, I heavily emphasized the&nbsp;<strong>functional testing</strong>&nbsp;feedback loop, because I knew that I&#39;d need to refine my ideas quite a bit before I could even think of making them particularly useful or interesting to others. But now that I have even the smallest nugget of meaningful functionality, I plan to spend the next few weeks taking a more balanced approach.<br>
<br>
In particular, I have two main goals that I want to hit within the next month:<br>
<br>
1) Retrace my steps to get this first demo level working in an alternate toolchain that will make the game easy to play without a complicated installation process (i.e. either a directly runnable executable or a browser-based game)<br>
<br>
2) Continue to do bottom up experiments to make a more attractive demonstration using the toolchain I&#39;m already familiar with. Not sure if this means improving aesthetics, building more interesting levels, or a combination of both, but I&#39;ll figure that out soon.<br>
,<br>
I will be sure to report back in a few weeks and let you know how it goes! Hope you found this useful, and I&#39;d love to hear about your own side projects... particularly if you need help figuring out how to balance your feedback loops!<br>

PPS: Thanks to the folks who had shared their own ideas in response to the last email. Several of you outlined a process not so different than the one I&#39;ve described in this essay, so I&#39;d be happy to hear more from you about what you think of this example. :-)</span> </div>
