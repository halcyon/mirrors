        <div class="message-body"> Hello, developer friend!<br>
<br>
I have to say I was surprised by the many thoughtful replies I received to my last email...&nbsp;I thought of it more like notes scribbled in the margins rather than a proper essay, but it generated some very interesting feedback.<br>
<br>
The basic story I was trying to tell in <em>Sharpening the Wrong Axe</em>&nbsp;is that sometimes we have a tendency to fixate on developing skills just because doing so makes us feel good; that there is a strong feedback loop that rewards us for focusing on one particular area of our skill set rather than looking at the bigger picture.<br>
<br>
I wanted to call out the dangerous nature of this way of working, because it tends to lead towards &quot;compulsive skill development&quot; rather than &quot;intentional skill development&quot; -- something I fear is deeply embedded in the current culture surrounding software development.<br>
<br>
Based on the feedback I received, I think I could have done better at pointing out that it&#39;s definitely the case that &quot;following your interests&quot; is both natural and healthy in moderation. The key is to remember that developing any particular skill is a self-reinforcing feedback loop, and in order to prevent yourself from developing extreme tunnel vision... it&#39;s necessary to have another feedback mechanism that acts as a sort of counterweight and keeps things in a state of balance.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;One way to do this is to check in with yourself on a regular interval, once a week or once a month, and think <em>&quot;What did I do this week? How does it fit into my long-term goals?&quot;&nbsp;</em>-- Simply asking this question is a good enough reality check, and will help you catch yourself when start heading too far down the rabbit hole.<br>
<br>
But there is also another way, and I didn&#39;t really think about it until I read some of your emails. And this way is certainly more fun: <strong>You allow yourself to dive into the deep end of something you&#39;re interested in, with the full intention of letting yourself get carried away with things, and with no expectation of creating something of value.</strong><br>
<br>
When you take this approach, there is no illusion that whatever you are practicing or studying is &quot;productive work&quot; ... there&#39;s full awareness that you&#39;re engaging in a form of play. And from there, you can treat this sort of activity as you would any other source of entertainment or hobby.<br>
<br>
Although you can&#39;t force it, a pleasant side effect of working this way is that while you are playing, you may end up developing useful things by pure chance. And if you&#39;re having fun, you may also manage to work through difficult or poorly understood terrain without ever really considering it &quot;work&quot; -- and that may leave you in place where you can help others who were driven to that space by necessity rather than interest.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
In my last email, I had talked about a multi-month foray into deep object-oriented design research that had initially been motivated by teaching practicing developers some useful concepts to apply in their daily work... but had somehow spiraled into me running over decades-old academic materials with a fine-tooth comb, much of it more closely resembling abstract math than anything related to real world software development.<br>
<br>
I had labeled this as a mistake, and I think it was: I had a journal to run and that journal was for folks who had practical jobs. I wanted to give them a taste of deeper theoretical ideas, but not ask them to drink an ocean of abstraction alongside me.<br>
<br>
But then after hearing a few of you say &quot;but there&#39;s value in doing things just for the fun of it,&quot; and &quot;there&#39;s value in knowing deep theory because it helps shape how you look at the world&quot; -- I have to say, I agree with both of those things. So the problem wasn&#39;t the deep dive, it was that I dove deep without remembering why I was doing it.<br>
<br>
As a counter example, another article I wrote was one that I had no intention to research or produce in the first place. I had been reading <em>G&ouml;del, Escher, Bach&nbsp;</em>at the time... which is an amazingly enjoyable mind trap for people who like that sort of thing. I then started to think on how the concepts in that book might relate to software development... especially as it relates to the connections between&nbsp;<strong>expressiveness&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;<strong>simplicity</strong>.<br>
<br>
What came out of this was an article with a pretty opaque title that I assumed few people would bother to read: <a href="https://www.practicingruby.com/articles/information-anatomy">The anatomy of information in software systems</a>. It was a complete joy to write and so it basically came for free, but I didn&#39;t expect it to be useful or interesting to those who don&#39;t study theory in their spare time.<br>
<br>
Oddly enough though, this article is one that I share more often now than many of my other, more vocationally-focused work. Here&#39;s why: <em>It explains a simple idea that is fundamental to what we do as software developers, but is often missed when we&#39;re focusing on the job to be done.</em><br>
<br>
The basic premise of the article is this: The more simple something is to process using a computer, the harder it is to understand... the more expressive and &#39;natural&#39; something is, the harder it is to implement with computers. This shows up in the difference between machine language and Python code, as well as the difference between a binary file format and JSON data. It shows up in choices like when to use full-stack web frameworks vs. minimal tooling that handles little more than HTTP requests.<br>
<br>
This one article is one of my favorite pieces of material I&#39;ve ever produced, and it came at me totally by accident. I don&#39;t think that&#39;s entirely coincidental.<br>
<br>
So hopefully with this follow-up, you can see that I definitely don&#39;t advocate a working style of &quot;all work and no play&quot; or &quot;serve everyone except yourself&quot; -- I just think we need to build some habits that prevent us from buying into the fallacy that &#39;do what you love&#39; is a singular path towards success and happiness.<br>
<br>
As long as you&#39;re able to see work as work and play as play... the two can overlap greatly as long as they don&#39;t conflict with one another.<br>
<br>
So... serve others well AND have fun. Just don&#39;t assume that those two things always need to happen at the same time. :-)<br>
