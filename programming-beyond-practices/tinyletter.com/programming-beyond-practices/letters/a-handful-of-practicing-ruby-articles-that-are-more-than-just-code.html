<br>
I started this newsletter&nbsp;to explore ideas for&nbsp;<strong><em>Programming Beyond Practices</em></strong>&nbsp;out in the open. By doing that, I&#39;ll discover what&#39;s interesting and useful to you, and your feedback will help me make a better book.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
I&#39;ve been thinking about these &quot;<em>beyond the code&quot;</em>&nbsp;topics for years... but the current book idea is brand new. Like nearly every other big, ambitious project I&#39;ve done, this one stems from a gut feeling that is pretty much only an hour old at this point. PrawnPDF was born this way, Mendicant University was born this way, and so was Practicing Ruby. I can&#39;t tell you exactly what lies on the path ahead, because I don&#39;t know that yet, and I will be relying on your help to figure out the path we end up taking.<br>
<br>
For now, let&#39;s glimpse into the past a bit. If you squint a little, you&#39;ll&nbsp;be able to get an idea for how this future book will look by reading the following Practicing Ruby articles:</div>

<ul>
	<li><a href="https://practicingruby.com/articles/sustainable-foss-quality?u=dc2ab0f9bb">Sustainable maintenance</a>: A collaboration w. Eric Hodel where we talk about letting external changes drive internal code quality improvements, treating all code without tests as legacy code (ala Michael Feathers), and expanding functionality of reusable code via stable extension points rather than implementing tons and tons&nbsp;features in a single codebase.<br>
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li><a href="https://practicingruby.com/articles/problem-discovery?u=dc2ab0f9bb">Problem Discovery comes before Problem Solving</a>: A brief case study on how to explore a business domain in the early stages of the requirements discovery phase to look for opportunities to write less code before jumping head first into an overly complicated &quot;perfect&nbsp;solution&quot;.<br>
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li><a href="https://practicingruby.com/articles/growing-a-stable-codebase">Guidelines for growing a stable codebase</a>: A collaboration with Jordan Byron where we discuss how to keep a project stable as it grows, even if you don&#39;t have a huge maintenance&nbsp;budget to work with. The key ingredients include: Incremental feature development, outside-in reviews of work in progress, active system monitoring at both the technical and business level, an easy way to revert changes, a clearly defined plan for dealing with any&nbsp;defects that are discovered in production, and the cultivation of a&nbsp;comprehensive regression testing safety net.<br>
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li><a href="https://practicingruby.com/articles/from-requirements-discovery-to-release">From requirements discovery to release</a>: The steps involved in going from a blank text file and an idea in your head to a (tiny) prototype that can be shared with others for their feedback, as seen in the context of a somewhat contrived little game I built.</li>
</ul>
Practicing Ruby is a code-heavy publication, so these articles were mostly written with that audience in mind. I imagine the<strong>&nbsp;</strong><em><strong>Programming Beyond Practices</strong>&nbsp;</em>book will have less code, but hopefully retain some degree of rigor through rich examples and case studies. I still need to imagine what that will look like, but for now think of something similar in spirit to the articles above, but without the need to dig through source code.<br>
<br>
This is just a starting point... a tiny kernel of an idea that needs much, much more time to percolate. But hopefully it at least captures your interest! I have many more stories to share, so if you have specific topics you are interested in, please reply to this email and I&#39;ll see if I can dig up something related to what you&#39;re struggling with.<br>
<br>
In any case, thanks for going on a weird and wild ride with me. It&#39;s gonna be fuuuuuuun! (and hard, and scary, and messy... but mostly fun) </div>
