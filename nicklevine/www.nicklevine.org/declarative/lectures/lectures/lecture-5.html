<p><b>Purpose:</b> Functions, recursive and iterative: the sordid truth
and other stuff
<p><b>5.1 Let's talk recursive</b>
<p>Suppose we are (still) trying to write a function which takes two arguments
- a list and a number - and if the number is = to the any element of the
list then return the position of that element in the list. (So if the number
matches the first element in the list return 0, if it matches the second
return 1, and so on.) If the number isn't found in the list, we'll return
<tt>nil</tt>.
<p>Here's one solution to the problem:
<blockquote><tt>(defun position-one (list number)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; (if list</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (if (= (first list) number)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (let* ((pos (position-one
(rest list) number)))</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (if pos</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(1+ pos)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
nil)))))</tt></blockquote>
And here's another:
<ul><tt>(defun position-two (list number &amp;optional (pos 0))</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; (if list</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (if (= (first list) number)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pos</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (position-two (rest
list) number (+ 1 pos)))))</tt></ul>
Both these solutions are <i>recursive</i> - the functions call themselves.
There are two official tips for how to write recursive functions (these
apply to any language, not just lisp):
<ul>
<li>
you need to find a way to reduce the problem to a slightly simpler case,
in the event that this time round wasn't the last pass, and</li>

<li>
you must ensure that <u>whatever the data to your function</u> it will
<i>terminate</i>,
i.e. not keep calling itself forever.</li>
</ul>
Also there is one unofficial tip:
<ul>
<li>
keep it as simple as you can possibly get away with. In my humble opinion
<tt>position-one</tt>
above is somewhat on the hairy side.</li>
</ul>
Points to note, if your lecturer hasn't already done so:
<ul>
<li>
the equivalence of the empty list and <i>logical false </i>- handy for
tests with <tt>if</tt></li>

<li>
the use of <tt>&amp;optional</tt> to allow functions to take a variable
number of arguments</li>

<li>
tail recursion...</li>
</ul>
What is <i>tail recursion</i>? Answer: a tail recursive function is one
in which the recursive call is the last thing it does. Why should that
matter to anybody? Answer: because (a) the compiler can transform it into
a loop, which will run faster and (b) if the compiler can write it as a
loop then so can you, which will save you all the aggro of having to think
recursively in the first place. :-) More on this later.
<p><b>5.2 Sinking without a trace</b>
<p>If you're stuck on seeing how these recursive functions work (and there
are plenty of further examples on the <a href="../index-2.html#solutions">solution
sheets</a>), you should consider <i>tracing</i> function calls. For example,
if you evaluate
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (trace position-two)</tt>
<br>- after defining the function! - and then call it with test data, you
will see a printout of all the recursive calls and their return values.
<ul>
<li>
Turn tracing off with <tt>(untrace position-two)</tt> or even <tt>(untrace)</tt>
to untrace everything.</li>

<li>
Be warned that tracing Common Lisp functions (as opposed to tracing your
own code) can get a little bit hectic. The reason for this is that there
is a strong possibility that the lisp system will be calling these functions
anyway, e.g. to handle redisplay of the listener brought on by printing
out all that tracing info.</li>
</ul>
Sometimes tracing won't be appropriate, and you may find yourself peppering
your code with print statements to get it debugged. If you need to do this,
you might as well make it quick'n'dirty rather than bothering with the
finesse of <tt>format</tt>.&nbsp; The function <tt>print</tt> takes a lisp
object and prints it (as the <tt>read-eval-print</tt> loop would, i.e.
as if with the format directive <tt>~s </tt>as opposed to the <tt>~a </tt>which
we've been using and which leaves output more human-readable). The printing
is preceded by a newline and followed by a space. [See also definitions
of <tt>prin1</tt> and <tt>princ</tt>.]
<p><b>5.3 Divertimento: several functions, a macro and a special operator</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<table CELLSPACING=15 WIDTH="100%" >
<tr ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP>
<td><tt>1+</tt>
<br><tt>1-</tt></td>

<td>These functions each take one argument (a number) and return it after
either adding or subtracting 1, as the case may be.&nbsp;
<br><tt>(1+ foo)</tt> is shorthand for <tt>(+ foo 1)</tt> and similarly
<tt>(1-
foo)</tt> abbreviates <tt>(- foo 1)</tt></td>
</tr>

<tr VALIGN=TOP>
<td><tt>consp</tt></td>

<td>Predicate, takes one argument and returns true if this is a cons, i.e.
a non-<tt>nil</tt> list.
<br>There is another predicate, <tt>atom</tt>, which does the opposite,
i.e. returns true if its argument is not a cons.</td>
</tr>

<tr VALIGN=TOP>
<td><tt>listp</tt></td>

<td>Predicate, takes one argument and returns true if this is a list, i.e.
either a cons or <tt>nil</tt>.&nbsp;</td>
</tr>

<tr VALIGN=TOP>
<td><tt>null</tt></td>

<td>Predicate, true of empty lists. Now, given the existence of <tt>not</tt>,
which is true if its argument is logically false, and given the equivalence
between logical false and the empty list, you might be justified in asking:
why bother? These two functions are the same. The answer is: use whichever
looks more appropriate, and keep your code readable. Thank you.</td>
</tr>

<tr VALIGN=TOP>
<td><tt>type-of</tt></td>

<td>Takes one argument and returns its type. Neat. Play with this!
<br>Note that the types returned by <tt>type-of</tt> will be the most specific
the system can come up with, which is not always the most useful answer
for you. For instance,
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (type-of "Hello World") =>&nbsp; simple-base-string</tt>
<br>(as opposed to <tt>string</tt>).</td>
</tr>

<tr VALIGN=TOP>
<td><tt>typep</tt></td>

<td>Predicate for determining whether its first argument is <i>of the type</i>
named by its second argument.
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (typep "Hello World" 'simple-base-string)&nbsp;
=>&nbsp; t</tt>
<br>Note that you do not have to be fully specific with the type here:
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (typep "Hello World" 'string)&nbsp; =>&nbsp;
t</tt>
<br>which is handy, because you can ask about the types you cared about
without fussing at all about the underlying depths if that's what you wanted.
So by <i>of the type</i> above, what I meant was <i>either it is of this
type or it is a subtype of this type.&nbsp;</i>
<p>All common types are associated with a <i>type predicate. </i>We met
three of these above:
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (consp foo)&nbsp; ===&nbsp; (typep foo
'cons)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (listp foo)&nbsp; ===&nbsp; (typep foo
'list)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (null foo)&nbsp;&nbsp; ===&nbsp; (typep
foo 'null)&nbsp; ===&nbsp; (not foo)</tt>
<br>Also:
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; symbolp</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sequencep</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; stringp</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; simple-base-string-p&nbsp;</tt>

<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; realp</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; integerp</tt>
<br>(and so on when you meet new types later in the course).
<p>You lecturer will now draw a diagram showing how all these types fit
together.&nbsp;</td>
</tr>

<tr VALIGN=TOP>
<td><tt>equal</tt></td>

<td>Predicate of two arguments: true if they are the "same". (Nebulous
concept, needs defining. At this stage in the game, if two objects print
out identically then they are <tt>equal</tt>. For what it's worth, if their
types are different then they cannot be equal.) For example:
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (equal (list 'foo 'bar 'baz) '(foo bar
baz))&nbsp; =>&nbsp; t</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (equal 'nick (car '(nick)))&nbsp; =>&nbsp;
t</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (equal 'nick "NICK")&nbsp; =>&nbsp; nil</tt></td>
</tr>

<tr VALIGN=TOP>
<td><tt>nth</tt></td>

<td><i>setfable </i>Takes a number and a list and uses the number to index
into that list. (Zero based.) Hideously inefficient with long lists, compared
with equivalent operation on arrays. Similarly
<tt>nthcdr</tt> for the
nth <tt>cdr</tt> of the list.
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (nth 0 '(1 2 3 4 5 6 7))&nbsp; =>&nbsp;
1</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (equal any-list (nthcdr 0 any-list))&nbsp;
=>&nbsp; t</tt></td>
</tr>

<tr VALIGN=TOP>
<td><tt>length</tt></td>

<td>Takes a list and returns its length. As with <tt>nth</tt>, has to traverse
the whole list.
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (length '(1 2 3 4 5 6 7))&nbsp; =>&nbsp;
7</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (length nil)&nbsp; =>&nbsp; 0</tt></td>
</tr>

<tr VALIGN=TOP>
<td><tt>last</tt></td>

<td>Returns the last cons in a list (the actual cons, not a copy of it):
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (last '(1 2 3 4 5 6 7))&nbsp; =>&nbsp;
(7)</tt>
<br>As above, takes longer with longer lists, but at least it's not as
bad (why?) as
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (let* ((list '(1 2 3 4 5 6 7)))&nbsp;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (nthcdr (1- (length
list)) list))</tt>
<br>Related to <tt>last</tt> is <tt>butlast</tt>, which returns a fresh
copy of a list but with the final element missed off.&nbsp;
<br>Both <tt>last</tt> and <tt>butlast</tt> take an optional second argument,
in case you want to include / exclude more than one element:
<br>&nbsp;<tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (last '(1 2 3 4 5 6 7) 2)&nbsp; =>&nbsp;
(6 7)</tt></td>
</tr>

<tr VALIGN=TOP>
<td><tt>copy-list</tt></td>

<td>Takes a list and returns a fresh copy of it. Each list is now safe
from destructive modification of the other.
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (let* ((original-list (list 0 2 3 4))</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (copied-list
(copy-list original-list)))</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (incf (first original-list))</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; copied-list)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; => (0 2 3 4)</tt>
<br>An impressive number of supposedly intractable bugs in major applications
can be traced back to failure to copy a list before modifying its guts.
You have been warned.</td>

<tr VALIGN=TOP>
<td><tt>reverse</tt></td>

<td>Takes a list and returns a fresh list with the old elements in reverse
order. Does not modify the old list.

(7 6 5 4 3 2 1)</tt></td>
</tr>

<tr VALIGN=TOP>
<td><tt>progn</tt></td>

<td>Special operator. Evaluates all its subforms and returns the value
produced by the last subform.

<p><b>5.4&nbsp; Let's get iterative</b>
<p>Lisp supplies you with a whole load of macros and functions to make
iteration simple. These range from fairly basic "loop forever until I tell
you to stop" constructs to highly complex packages supporting specialized
data structures, or lazy evaluation (see appendices to Cltl2). Let's start
with the macro<tt> dolist:</tt>
<blockquote><tt>(dolist (variable expression &amp;optional result-form)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; form-1</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; ...</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; form-n)</tt></blockquote>
This macro is used for iterating along a list. The <tt>expression</tt>
is evaluated, and it should come out as a list. The variable <tt>variable</tt>
is bound to the first element in the list and the forms <tt>form-1 ...
form-n</tt> are evaluated as an implicit <tt>progn</tt>. Then <tt>variable</tt>
is bound to the second element in the list and the forms are evaluated
again, and so on down the list until it runs out.
<p>If <tt>result-form</tt> is present it is evaluated (with <tt>variable</tt>
bound to <tt>nil</tt>, fwiw) and its value is the return value of <tt>dolist</tt>,
otherwise <tt>dolist</tt> returns <tt>nil</tt>.
<p>If you want to bail out of a <tt>dolist</tt> loop before the list has
been used up, use the macro <tt>return</tt>. This takes an optional return
value (to be evaluated), otherwise <tt>dolist</tt> still returns <tt>nil</tt>.
<p>Examples:
<blockquote><tt>(defun my-reverse (old-list)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; (let* ((new-list nil))</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (dolist (elt old-list)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (push elt new-list))</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; new-list))</tt>
<br><tt>(my-reverse '(alpha beta gamma))&nbsp; =>&nbsp; (gamma beta alpha)</tt>
<p><tt>(defun position-three (list number)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; (let ((count 0))</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (dolist (var list)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (if (= var number)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (return
count))</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (incf count))))</tt></blockquote>
A similar macro is <tt>dotimes:</tt>
<blockquote><tt>(dotimes (variable expression &amp;optional result-form)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; form-1</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; ...</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; form-n)</tt></blockquote>
This macro is used for iterating while incrementing a counter. The <tt>expression</tt>
is evaluated, and this time it should come out as an integer. The variable
<tt>variable</tt>
is bound to <tt>0</tt> first time round the loop, then
<tt>1</tt>, etc
until the loop has been been executed <tt>expression</tt> times. If
<tt>result-form</tt>
is present it is evaluated (with <tt>variable</tt> incremented one final
time to give you the number of times the body of the loop was executed);
return values and use of the macro <tt>return</tt> are exactly as for <tt>dolist</tt>.
Examples:
<blockquote><tt>(dotimes (foo 10 foo))&nbsp; =>&nbsp; 10</tt>
<p><tt>(setf bar 0)</tt>
<br><tt>(dotimes (foo 10)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; (incf bar))&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
=>&nbsp; nil</tt>
<br><tt>bar&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
=>&nbsp; 10</tt>
<p><tt>(let* ((list nil))</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; (dotimes (i 5)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (push i list))</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; list)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
=> (4 3 2 1 0)</tt></blockquote>
There is a fun example with palindromic strings on the HyperSpec page on
<tt>dotimes</tt>.
<p><b>5.5 Functions can iterate too</b>
<p>If you need to bomb down a list in a hurry (and it's your valuable time
as a slothful typist I'm thinking of here), you should consider the following
incredibly neat function.
<blockquote><tt>(mapcar '1+ '(1 4 9 16))&nbsp; =>&nbsp; (2 5 10 17)</tt>
<br><tt>(mapcar 'evenp '(1 2 3 4 5))&nbsp; =>&nbsp; (nil t nil t nil)</tt>
<br><tt>(mapcar 'type-of (list "my" (+ 1 2) 'sons))</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
=>&nbsp; (simple-base-string fixnum symbol)</tt>
<br><tt>(mapcar 'length '(() (()) (()()) (()()()) (()()()())))&nbsp; =>&nbsp;
(0 1 2 3 4)</tt></blockquote>
So what does <tt>mapcar</tt> do? At its simplest it takes a function and
a list. The function is passed members of the list, one at a time, and
its return values are collected into a fresh list which is itself returned
from <tt>mapcar</tt>.
<p>Hang on. <i>Takes a function</i>?<b> </b>How do you pass a function
around? Answer: simple, just quote its name. As above.
<p>Another example:
<blockquote><tt>(defun my-copy-list (list)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; (mapcar 'identity list))</tt></blockquote>
Stuck? Try tracing (see 5.2 above) the function which is being passed to
<tt>mapcar</tt>,
i.e. <tt>1+</tt>, <tt>evenp</tt>, ..., <tt>identity</tt> in the above.
<p><b>5.6 More on mapcar</b>
<p>In all the examples above, <tt>mapcar</tt> was passed a function which
itself took one argument. Now, this need not be the case. More examples:
<blockquote><tt>(mapcar '+ '(1 2 3) '(4 5 6))&nbsp; =>&nbsp; (5 7 9)</tt>
<br><tt>(mapcar '&lt; '(1 2 3) '(3 2 1))&nbsp; =>&nbsp; (t nil nil)</tt>
<br><tt>(mapcar 'list '(one two three four) '(1 2 3 4) '("I" "II" "III"
"IV"))</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; =>&nbsp; ((one 1 "I")</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (two 2 "II")</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (three 3 "III")</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (four 4 "IV"))</tt></blockquote>
The function handed to <tt>mapcar</tt> should take as many arguments as
there are lists. First time around, it is called with the first element
of each list, and so on. If the lists turn out to be of different lengths,
<tt>mapcar</tt>
halts as soon as any of them run out:
<blockquote><tt>(mapcar '/ '(0 1 2) '(3 2 1 0))&nbsp; =>&nbsp; (0 1/2 2)&nbsp;
; no division by zero</tt></blockquote>
Finally, if you want to do iteration like this without the overhead of
collecting results into a list, call <tt>mapc</tt> instead:
<blockquote><tt>(mapc 'print (list foo bar baz))</tt></blockquote>
will print out the values of <tt>foo bar </tt>and <tt>baz</tt>. For want
of anything better, <tt>mapc</tt> returns the first list passed to it,
and programmers generally throw this value away. In other words, <tt>mapc</tt>
is called for side effects only.
<p><b>5.7 Practical session</b>
<ol>
<li>
Use <tt>dolist</tt> to write a function which adds together (i.e. sums)
all the elements in a list.</li>

<li>
Use <tt>dotimes</tt> to implement the <tt>factorial</tt> function.</li>

<li>
Implement the following Common Lisp functions recursively (n.b. give them
new names or you will upset your lisp session)</li>

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <tt>length copy-list
reverse</tt>
<li>
Repeat the above (apart from <tt>reverse</tt> whose solution was given
above) with <tt>dolist</tt>. Which ones get easier? Which get harder?</li>

<li>
Rewrite the function</li>

<ol TYPE=a><tt>(defun multi-type-of (list)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; (if list</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (cons (type-of (first list))</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(multi-type-of (rest list)))))</tt>
<li>
with <tt>mapcar</tt></li>

<li>
with <tt>dolist</tt></li>
</ol>
Which of the three approaches do you prefer?
<li>
Use <tt>mapc</tt> to write a function which takes a list and prints a dot
for each member of the list:</li>

<ol><tt>(dotty '(a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o))</tt>
<br><tt>...............</tt>
<br><tt>=>&nbsp; nil ; actually you need _two_ functions to do this ;-)</tt></ol>
</ol>
<b>5.8 Suggested activity / exercises etc</b>
<center>
<p><b>&nbsp;<u><font size=+1> MAKE SURE YOU UNDERSTAND IT ALL, NOW</font></u></b></center>

<ol>
<li>
Go through your lecture notes and check you are happy with <b><i>everything
</i></b>to
date. Fire up a lisp session and experiment with every function etc introduced
so far (one-liners will do) to check your understanding.
<b><i>Anything</i></b>
you don't understand from the notes: look it up in Graham, Cltl2, the HyperSpec.
<b><i>Come
and ask me</i></b> if you're still stuck. See my office door for consultation
times.</li>

<li>
Make <b><i>very certain</i></b> that you can by now write simple lisp functions.
Examples:</li>

<ol TYPE=a>
<li>
take two numbers (i.e. write a function of two arguments) and sum them</li>

<li>
take a list of two numbers (i.e. write a function of one argument) and
sum them</li>

<li>
take an arbitrary list of numbers and sum them</li>

<li>
take a list of numbers and return a list of all the numbers which were
negative</li>
</ol>
I would hope by now that you can do all four of these; I would accept it
if you could produce working versions of the first three; I would be worried
if you can't get the first two right. <b><i>Come and ask me</i></b> if
you're stuck. See my office door for consultation times.
<li>
Complete any exercises from previous weeks and any unfinished practical
work. I have deliberately set lots so that there is more than one example
of each concept. Try without the <a href="../solutions/solutions-5.html">solutions</a>
first but - failing that - look them up.
<b><i>Come and ask me</i></b>
if you're stuck.</li>

<li>
Go through the above notes and answer all the rhetorical questions.</li>

<li>
Experiment with different arguments to <tt>type-of</tt> to see how many
different return values you can get it to produce. (Rate yourself:- 4:
good, 5: very good, 7 great, 9: excellent)</li>

<li>
Implement <tt>my-consp</tt> in terms of <tt>type-of</tt> and <tt>my-listp</tt>
in terms of <tt>my-consp</tt>.</li>

<li>
Why would</li>

<ol><tt>(defun last (list)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; (nthcdr (1- (length list)) list))</tt></ol>
be considered inefficient?
<li>
What's wrong with</li>

<ol><tt>(defun copy-list (list)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; (reverse (reverse list)))</tt></ol>
as a means of copying lists?
<li>
The body of the macro <tt>defun</tt> is an implicit <tt>progn</tt>. Name
