<br><b><font size=+3>Lecture #12</font></b></center>

<p><b>Purpose: Loose ends / CLOS in 10 minutes / revision quiz / summary</b>
<p><b>12.1 Loose ends</b>
<p>There are a couple of specific points that I want to tie up. The first
is that one of the great things about lisp is that it offers so many different
ways of expressing your intent. Recall from the first lecture:
<blockquote>
<center><i>A <a href="http://www.cs.rochester.edu/u/www/courses/108/glossary/Declarative_Language.html">declarative
language</a> is a language in which you describe the problem you are working
on and the computer decides how to solve it. Lisp and Prolog are declarative
languages.</i>
<p><i>On the other hand a <a href="http://www.cs.rochester.edu/u/www/courses/108/glossary/Prodedural_Language.html">procedural
language</a> is a language in which you tell the computer what to do. The
machine will then do what you tell it and you hope that what it tells you
is the answer to the question you wanted to ask. Pascal is a procedural
language.</i></center>
</blockquote>
I am still unhappy with the thought of languages being <i>declarative</i>
(if that is what the word means) - although code like
<blockquote><tt>(def-url "/" ...)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ; define root
page of my web server</tt></blockquote>
is getting close to that ideal. However, I think it is indisputable that
lisp gives you so many ways of telling the computer what to do that you
can effectively get on with the task of describing your actual problem
relatively unencumbered by small details.
<p>For example, the following would all find the position in the list <tt>things</tt>
of a sublist of length 1. The first is fairly compact, and fine if you
know how to use the <tt>:key</tt> argument to <tt>position</tt>. The next
is almost as neat but depends on knowing about <tt>position-if</tt>, the
third works but might be criticized for wasteful allocation (generating
a list of length <tt>(length things)</tt> and then throwing it away again).
The <tt>dolist</tt> form uses "primitive" parts, which is fine and might
even in some circumstances run faster than the others; the <tt>mapc</tt>-closure
solution is quite frankly revolting. Presumably, we could also have written
a recursive function to do the search.
<blockquote><tt>(position 1 things :key 'length)</tt>
<p><tt>(position-if #'(lambda (x) (= (length x) 1)) things)</tt>
<p><tt>(position 1 (mapcar 'length things))</tt>
<p><tt>(let ((where 0))</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; (dolist (x things)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (when (= (length x) 1)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (return where))</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (incf where)))</tt>
<p><tt>(block found</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; (let ((where 0))</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (mapc #'(lambda (x)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(when (and x (not (cdr x)))</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(return-from found where))</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(incf where))</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; things))</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; nil)</tt></blockquote>
A lot of the functions I have told you about take additional (optional)
arguments, and I may not always have told you about these. They quite frequently
permit greater flexibility, and sometimes additional sophistication, in
how you use them. For example, the following
<blockquote><tt>(or (gethash key table)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; default)</tt>
<p><tt>(gethash key table default)</tt></blockquote>
both allow you to retrieve a value from a hash-table and state a default
value in case the <tt>key</tt> wasn't present. However, suppose that the
<tt>key
</tt><u>is</u>
present in the table, and the value stored against it is
<tt>nil</tt>.
In the first case above, <tt>gethash</tt> returns <tt>nil</tt> and so the
<tt>or</tt>
form returns <tt>default</tt>; in the second, <tt>gethash</tt> again finds
<tt>key</tt>
and returns <tt>nil</tt>. So the second form, while ostensibly similar
to the first, can be used to distinguish between a stored value of <tt>nil</tt>
and no stored value.
<p>You'll find many cases like this in lisp: where different treatments
can have similar results but for fine tuning you have to really know how
each operator works.
<p><b>12.2 What did we miss out?&nbsp;&nbsp; </b>(incorporating "CLOS in
ten minutes"<sup>TM</sup>)
<p>We have covered <a href="../additional/index.html">around 160 Common
Lisp symbols</a> - looked at one way that's one sixth of the language.
In practice, it's considerably more than that because a lot of the remaining
symbols involve more book-work to cover less ground. (Or: less dramatic
ground.) I'd reckon we're about half-way there. We didn't touch:
<ul>
<li>
packages (other than in passing)</li>

<li>
streams (other than in passing)</li>

<li>
pathnames (other than very much in passing)</li>

<li>
compilation issues</li>

<li>
declarations</li>

<li>
optimization</li>

<li>
defining your own <tt>setf</tt> behaviour</li>

<li>
multiple values (other than in passing)</li>

<li>
the complex loop macro</li>

<li>
the condition system</li>

<li>
advanced macro building techniques</li>

<li>
extending the syntax</li>

<li>
vast numbers of functions dealing with lists, arrays, string, characters,
numbers</li>
</ul>
<b>12.3 Summary</b>
<p>So why use Lisp? Because it is
<ul>
<li>
Standardized</li>

<li>
Extensible</li>

<li>
Dynamic</li>

<li>
Large</li>

<li>
Powerful</li>

<li>

</ul>
It offers (see also <a href="http://www.xanalys.com/software_tools/products/myths_and_legends.html">the
white paper</a>)
<ul>
<li>
simple consistent syntax</li>

<li>
a rich set of datatypes</li>

<li>

<li>
stunningly powerful macro system ("programs as data")</li>

<li>
features (such as <tt>unwind-protect </tt>and closures) which you simply
won't find elsewhere</li>
</ul>
It is particularly suitable for applications which are
<ul>
<li>
large and complex</li>

<li>
server side</li>

<li>
non-stop</li>
</ul>

<b>12.5 Practical session / Suggested activity</b>
<ul>
<li>
Implement a recursive function to find the position in a given list of
a sublist of length 1.</li>

<li>
Implement the function <tt>append</tt>. Is your solution elegant? fast?
robust?</li>

<li>
Implement a function which takes a lisp object and says something useful
about it (the way that <tt>describe</tt> does).</li>

<li>
Go back through all the practicals and exercises and complete everything
you missed out first time through.</li>
</ul>
<b>12.6 Revision reading</b>
<ul>
<li>
Graham chapters 1-8 and 10</li>

<li>
Take at least one look through chapter 13 and appendix D of Graham.</li>
</ul>
As a final word, I just want to thank all my students at APU for helping
me deliver this course, for working so hard and (I hope) for coming to
appreciate at least the edges of why for me lisp is the <u>only</u> language
to write your programs in.
