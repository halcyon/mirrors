<p><b>Purpose: Equality, hash-tables and blocks.</b>
<p><b>8.1 Introduction: equality</b>
<p>We encountered earlier various predicates for comparing specific types
of lisp object:
<ul>
<li>
<tt>=</tt> for numbers (compares any number of objects)</li>

<li>
<tt>char=</tt> for characters (compares any number of objects)</li>

<li>
<tt>string=</tt> and <tt>string-equal</tt> for strings (compares precisely
two objects)</li>
</ul>
and one predicate
<ul>
<li>
<tt>equal</tt> (compares precisely two objects)</li>
</ul>
for comparing general lisp objects. I have assured you that if two objects
print the same then they are <tt>equal</tt>. Now let's get closer to the
truth, by introducing two further general equality predicates (each taking
precisely two arguments): the functions <tt>eq</tt> and
<tt>eql</tt>.
<p><b>8.2 Equality and eq</b>
<p>Two objects are <tt>eq</tt> only if they are in fact the <i>same object</i>.
Quite how this works depends on their types. Obviously, if the objects
have different types they cannot be the same object and so they cannot
be <tt>eq</tt>.
<ul>
<li>
If two <u>symbols</u> print the same then they are defined to be identical
and hence they are guaranteed to be
<tt>eq</tt>:</li>

<ul><tt>(mapcar 'eq '(foo t nil :wibble) '(foo t nil :wibble))&nbsp; =>&nbsp;
(t t t t)</tt></ul>

<li>
If two <u>integers</u> have the same value and are <tt>fixnum</tt> then
they are
<tt>eq</tt>. To be <i>fixnum</i>, an integer has to be between
the constants <tt>most-negative-fixnum</tt> and <tt>most-positive-fixnum</tt>
inclusive. The values of these two numbers is implementation-dependent.</li>

<ul>
<li>
In LispWorks for Windows, these values are -2<sup>23</sup> and +2<sup>23</sup>-1.
Most implementations these days go higher than that in the fixnum range
(typically to 2<sup>28
</sup>or 2<sup>29</sup>).</li>
</ul>

<li>
In theory, you cannot guarantee that typing in the same <u>character</u>
twice will result in two <tt>eq</tt> objects: eg</li>

<ul><tt>(eq #\Space #\Space)</tt></ul>
may turn out to be false. In practice however no implementation worth its
salt will harass you like this and for LispWorks the above expression is
true.
<li>
With <u>any other objects</u>, looking the same is no guarantee of <tt>eq</tt>.
Typing in two identical looking <i>bignums</i> (that's an integer which
is not a fixnum), or floats, or lists, or strings, or vectors, will result
in numbers which are <tt>=</tt>, or in sequences which have the same members,
but it has generated different structures with different addresses in memory
and these will not be <tt>eq</tt>.</li>

<ul><tt>(eq 1.0 1.0)&nbsp; =>&nbsp; nil</tt>
<br><tt>(eq 8388608 8388608)&nbsp; =>&nbsp; nil&nbsp; ; but may be t in
other implementations</tt>
<br><tt>(eq '(a b c) '(a b c))&nbsp; =>&nbsp; nil</tt>
<br><tt>(eq "this takes some thought" "this takes some thought")&nbsp;
=>&nbsp; nil</tt></ul>
</ul>
If you have two pointers to the same thing then they will be <tt>eq</tt>.
For example, <tt>(eq something something)</tt> is true no matter what value
<tt>something</tt>
has. The following function too will always return true (for any argument):
<blockquote><tt>(defun always-true (thing)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; (let* ((my-list (list thing)))</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (eq thing (first my-list))))</tt></blockquote>
Note that if a function generates new objects, then these cannot be <tt>eq</tt>
to each other:
<blockquote><tt>CL-USER 21 > (let* ((things nil))</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(dotimes (i 2)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(push '(t) things))&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ; pushing the same object each time</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(eq (first things)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(second things)))</tt>
<br><tt>T</tt>
<p><tt>CL-USER 22 > (let* ((things nil))</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(dotimes (i 2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
; pushing s new object each time</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(push (list t) things))</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(eq (first things)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(second things)))</tt>
<br><tt>NIL</tt>
<p><tt>CL-USER 23 ></tt></blockquote>
This includes all functions (e.g. <tt>copy-list</tt>) which are defined
as returning a <i>fresh copy</i> of some object, for example:
<p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (let* ((foo '(1 2 3 4))) (equal foo (butlast
foo 0)))&nbsp; =>&nbsp; t</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (let* ((foo '(1 2 3 4))) (eq foo (butlast foo
0)))&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; =>&nbsp; nil</tt>
<p><b>8.3 Equality and eql</b>
<p>Two objects are <tt>eql</tt> if
<ul>
<li>
they are <tt>eq</tt> or</li>

<li>
they are both <u>numbers</u> of the same type and the same value or</li>

<li>
they are both <u>characters</u> that represent the same character (as noted
above, this distinction is not worth bothering with and you can in practice
assume that two identical looking characters are <tt>eql</tt> simply because
they are <tt>eq</tt>).</li>
</ul>
A large number of lisp functions use a predicate for comparing objects;
this tends to be specified as an optional argument and the default value
is typically <tt>eql</tt> (see section 17.2.1 of the HyperSpec). As an
example, consider the function <tt>position</tt> which takes an object
and a sequence, and returns the first index into the sequence at which
the object was found (or <tt>nil</tt> if it was not found):
<blockquote><tt>(position 'wibble '(foo bar wibble baz wombat))&nbsp; =>&nbsp;
2</tt></blockquote>
The objects are compared by <tt>eql</tt>, unless another predicate is handed
in as the value to the <tt>:test </tt>argument
<blockquote><tt>(position "wibble" '("foo" "bar" "wibble" "baz" "wombat"))</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; =>&nbsp; nil</tt>
<br><tt>(position "wibble" '("foo" "bar" "wibble" "baz" "wombat") :test
'string=)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; =>&nbsp; 2</tt></blockquote>
Related to <tt>position</tt> is the function <tt>position-if</tt> which
takes a predicate (of one argument) and a sequence:
<blockquote><tt>(position-if (lambda (x) (and (numberp x) (plusp x) (evenp
x)))</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
'(digits of pi are 3 1 4 1 5 9))</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; =>&nbsp; 6</tt></blockquote>
and related to both of these are <tt>find</tt> and <tt>find-if,</tt> which
return the item which was found rather than its position.
<blockquote><tt>(let ((bits '("foo" "bar" "wibble" "baz" "wombat")))</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; (eq (third bits)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "wibble"))&nbsp; =>&nbsp; nil</tt>
<p><tt>(let ((bits '("foo" "bar" "wibble" "baz" "wombat")))</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; (eq (third bits)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (find "wibble" bits :test 'string=)))&nbsp;
=>&nbsp; t</tt></blockquote>
<b>8.4 Revisiting equal</b>
<p>Two objects are <tt>equal</tt> if
<ul>
<li>
they are <tt>eql</tt> or</li>

<li>
they are <tt><u>strings</u></tt>, of the same length, which match (by <tt>eql</tt>)
character for character or</li>

<li>
they are both of type <tt><u>cons</u></tt> and</li>

<ol TYPE=a>
<li>
the two <tt>car</tt>s are <tt>equal</tt> and</li>

<li>
the two <tt>cdr</tt>s are <tt>equal</tt></li>
</ol>

<li>
(there are a couple of further conditions under which this predicate is
true but we haven't met the objects they apply to yet)</li>
</ul>
<b>8.5 Hash-tables (an excuse for knowing about eql)</b>
<p>We know about the following general (in the sense that they can contain
any lisp objects) data structures:
<ul>
<li>
<tt>cons</tt>: used for building lists and trees; good for flexibility
as you can add or remove cells very easily; slow access over long sequence</li>

<li>
<tt>vector</tt>: one-dimensional array; inflexible but fast access no matter
how large the sequence</li>

<li>
<tt>structure</tt>: user-defined type; behaves like a vector whose fields
are named rather than numbered</li>
</ul>
We now introduce the <tt>hash-table</tt>.&nbsp; This is a data structure
whose indices may be general lisp objects, which offers flexibility similar
to lists and which delivers lookup times intermediate between lists and
vectors.
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER CELLPADDING=10 COLS=6 WIDTH="100%" >
<tr ALIGN=CENTER VALIGN=TOP>
<td><b>Name</b></td>

<td><b>Index by</b></td>

<td><b>Flexibility</b></td>

<td><b>Data ordered into sequence?</b></td>

<td><b>Speed</b></td>

<td><b>Use</b></td>
</tr>

<tr VALIGN=TOP>
<td><tt>cons</tt></td>

<td><tt>first</tt> and <tt>rest</tt></td>

<td ALIGN=CENTER>good</td>

<td ALIGN=CENTER>yes</td>

<td>slow access over long sequence</td>

<td>building lists and binary trees</td>
</tr>

<tr VALIGN=TOP>
<td><tt>vector</tt></td>

<td>numerical index</td>

<td ALIGN=CENTER>poor</td>

<td ALIGN=CENTER>yes</td>

<td>fast, independent of length of sequence</td>

<td>random lookup and rapid traversal of large data sets</td>
</tr>

<tr VALIGN=TOP>
<td><tt>structure</tt></td>

<td>field name (not available at run-time)</td>

<td ALIGN=CENTER>poor</td>

<td ALIGN=CENTER>no</td>

<td>fast, independent of number of fields</td>

<td>user-defined types</td>
</tr>

<tr VALIGN=TOP>
<td><tt>hash-table</tt></td>

<td>any lisp object</td>

<td ALIGN=CENTER>good</td>

<td ALIGN=CENTER>no</td>

<td>intermediate</td>

<td>dictionaries, general object maps</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>If we weren't bothered about lookup times, we could implement something
like this with lists:
<ul><tt>CL-USER 11 > (defun get-from-list (index list)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(dolist (list-member list)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(let* ((maybe-index (first list-member))</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(maybe-value (second list-member)))</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(if (equal index maybe-index)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(return maybe-value)))))</tt>
<br><tt>GET-FROM-LIST</tt>
<p><tt>CL-USER 12 > (defparameter phone-numbers</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
'(("Nick" 2330) ("Martin R" 2356) ("Bob" 2342)))</tt>
<br><tt>PHONE-NUMBERS</tt>
<p><tt>CL-USER 13 > (get-from-list "Bob" phone-numbers)</tt>
<br><tt>2342</tt>
<p><tt>CL-USER 14 > (get-from-list "Ethel the Aardvark" phone-numbers)</tt>
<br><tt>NIL</tt>
<p><tt>CL-USER 15 ></tt></ul>
(and with more, slightly nastier code to add, reset and remove the phone
numbers). Using hash-tables hides the above nastiness and is reasonably
fast even when it gets large.
<p>To make a hash-table, call the function <tt>make-hash-table</tt>. To
look values up in the table use the function <tt>gethash</tt> (setfable).
To remove a single entry altogether use <tt>remhash</tt>, and to empty
a hash-table completely call <tt>clrhash</tt>. For example:
<ul><tt>CL-USER 9 > (defparameter *table* (make-hash-table :test 'equal))</tt>
<br><tt>*TABLE*</tt>
<p><tt>CL-USER 10 > (dolist (pair '(("Nick" 2330) ("Martin R" 2356) ("Bob"
2342)))</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(let* ((key (first pair))</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(value (second pair)))</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(setf (gethash key *table*) value)))</tt>
<br><tt>NIL</tt>
<p><tt>CL-USER 11 > (gethash "Bob" *table*)</tt>
<br><tt>2342</tt>
<br><tt>T</tt>
<p><tt>CL-USER 12 > (gethash "Ethel the Aardvark" *table*)</tt>
<br><tt>NIL</tt>
<br><tt>NIL</tt>
<p><tt>CL-USER 13 ></tt></ul>
Notes:
<ul>
<li>
<tt>make-hash-table</tt> takes a keyword argument <tt>:test </tt>which
determines how keys (i.e. the <i>indices</i>) will be compared. You do
not have an open choice of any predicate here: you are limited to <tt>eq
eql equal </tt>and <tt>equalp</tt> (look this last one up if you feel a
burning urge to do so). The default test is, as ever, <tt>eql</tt>.</li>

<li>
<tt>gethash</tt> is like <tt>nth</tt> (and unlike <tt>aref</tt>): it takes
the key as first argument and the table comes second.</li>

<li>
<tt>gethash</tt> returns two values (like <tt>read-line</tt> did): the
second value tells you whether anything was found or not. This allows you
to distinguish between finding <tt>nil</tt> and not finding anything (in
both cases, the <i>primary</i> return value is <tt>nil</tt>).</li>

<li>
<tt>(setf gethash)</tt> can be used both to add new values to the table
(as in the above example) and to reset existing values.</li>
</ul>
Once you've built a hash-table, a useful function for traversing it is
<tt>maphash</tt>,
which takes a function and hash-table as arguments. The function is invoked
repeatedly for each entry in the table, with two arguments (a key and the
corresponding value). For example:
<ul><tt>CL-USER 13 > (maphash (lambda (name number)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(format t "~&amp;~a is on extension ~a"</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
name number))</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
*table*)</tt>
<br><tt>Nick is on extension 2330</tt>
<br><tt>Martin R is on extension 2356</tt>
<br><tt>Bob is on extension 2342</tt>
<br><tt>NIL</tt>
<p><tt>CL-USER 14 ></tt></ul>
Note:
<ul>
<li>
the order in which the entries are processed by <tt>maphash</tt> is implementation
defined and may even not be the same twice running.</li>

<li>
<tt>maphash</tt> always returns <tt>nil</tt>.</li>
</ul>
<b>8.6 Blocks</b>
<p>We have met the macro <tt>return</tt> which allows "premature" exit
from the various looping macros (<tt>dotimes dolist loop</tt> etc). A generalization
of this is the special operator <tt>return-from</tt> which in particular
allows early exit from any (named) function.
<br>&nbsp;
<blockquote><tt>CL-USER 14 > (defun one-value (table)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(maphash (lambda (key value)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(declare (ignore key))</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(return-from one-value</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
value))</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
table))</tt>
<br><tt>ONE-VALUE</tt>
<p><tt>CL-USER 15 > (one-value *table*)</tt>
<br><tt>2330</tt>
<p><tt>CL-USER 16 ></tt></blockquote>
The above (admittedly somewhat pointless) function returns one value extracted
from the hash-table supplied as its argument.
<ul>
<li>
When we're within the body of a (named) function, we are said to also be
inside a <i>block</i> with the same name. So while we are in the body of
<tt>one-value</tt>,
we are inside a block named <tt>one-value</tt>.</li>

<li>
Within a block, you can leave at any time with the special operator <tt>return-from</tt>.
It takes two arguments: the first (not evaluated) is the name of the block
you want to leave, the second (evaluated; optional and defaulting to <tt>nil</tt>)
is the value to return.</li>

<li>
The looping macros (<tt>dotimes dolist loop</tt> etc) establish a block
named <tt>nil</tt>, so you could exit them by calling <tt>(return-from
nil)</tt>. The macro <tt>return</tt> is shorthand for this.</li>

<li>
The above examples of blocks (established by <tt>defun</tt> or by the looping
macros) are said to be <i>implicit</i>, because they are created behind
your back. You can establish blocks of your own, at any point in your code,
using the special operator <tt>block</tt> (look it up in the HyperSpec).</li>

<li>
The special operator <tt>return-from</tt> is said to be <i>lexical</i>
in scope - it only works within the textual confines of the block it refers
to.</li>
</ul>
Also in the above code you should be aware of the following:
<ul>
<li>
In the lambda form in <tt>one-value</tt>, two arguments have to be supplied
(because that's how <tt>maphash</tt> works) but only one is actually wanted
(or used). The <tt>(declare (ignore ...))</tt> form is included immediately
after the parameter list to prevent compiler warning along the lines of</li>

<ul><tt>;;;*** Warning in ONE-VALUE: KEY is bound but not referenced</tt></ul>
Declarations can appear after function parameter lists, after the bindings
in <tt>let*</tt>, and in many other macros and special operators - see
figure 3-23 in the HyperSpec for the full list.</ul>
<b>8.7 Practical session / Suggested activity</b>
<p>Convert last week's work to store student records in a hash-table (accessible
by name) rather than in a list. Write functions to add a new student, to
find the record of a student with a given name, and to delete a student.
<p>As before, write functions to name the three students who have the highest
marks, or to spot which lecturer fails most of their students.
<p>Use <tt>return-from</tt> in a function to return the SID of any student
who hasn't attmpted any modules at all.
<p>Comment on which data stucture was "best". [Define "best".]
<p><b>8.8&nbsp; Further reading &amp; exercises</b>
<ul>
<li>
Look up the definitions of the functions <tt>eq</tt>, <tt>eql</tt> and
<tt>equal</tt>
in the HyperSpec. Try out many examples. Make really sure you appreciate
the difference between them.</li>

<li>
Either: justify carefully the statement that "if two objects print the
same then they are
<tt>equal</tt>." or give a simple counter-example. Consider
vectors.</li>

<li>
Define your own version of <tt>equal</tt> (call it <tt>my-equal</tt>) in
terms of <tt>eql</tt>; define <tt>eql</tt> in terms of <tt>eq</tt>, <tt>=</tt>
and <tt>char=</tt>.</li>

<li>
Actually, <tt>position</tt> takes more keyword arguments than the one (<tt>:test</tt>)
given above. Look them up and try them out.</li>

<li>
To see multiple-values taken to a mild excess, call the function <tt>(get-decoded-time)</tt>.&nbsp;
If you can't figure out what the result means, try calling it once or twice
more (and then, if necessary, either ask me or look it up). Read section
5.5 of Graham and implement a function which prints today's date, or the
time, or both. (You might attempt to emulate the format of UNIX date(1),
eg <tt>"Fri Sep 15 14:12:41 BST 2000"</tt>.)</li>

<li>
Write a function of two arguments which simply returns its first argument.
Defining your function should not cause any warnings to be signalled.</li>

<li>
Redefine function <tt>position-three</tt> (section 5.4) to use <tt>return-from</tt>
rather than <tt>return</tt>. Do this twice: first returning from a block
named <tt>nil</tt>, then returning instead from a block named <tt>position-three</tt>.
Does either of these new functions give you anything which the original
didn't?</li>

<li>
Define a function which doubles every member of a list. If any member of
that list is not a number, simply return <tt>nil</tt> from your function.</li>

<li>
Suppose by some ghastly misunderstanding there was a lisp where the implementers
had forgotten to include the type <tt>vector</tt> or any operations based
on it.</li>

<br>See if you can use hash-tables to plug the gap, implementing enough
of the basics (<tt>my-make-array</tt>,&nbsp; <tt>my-length</tt>, <tt>my-aref</tt>
and <tt>my-setf-aref </tt>at the very least) to prove that the concept
works. Make sure that <tt>my-aref</tt> checks that the index is within
bounds (you can store the upper-bound in the hash-table).
