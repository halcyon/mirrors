<center><b><font size=+3>Declarative Languages</font></b>
<br><b><font size=+3>Lecture #1</font></b></center>

<p><b>Purpose: </b>To introduce the course, give background, and deal with
various administrative issues.
<p><b>1.1 What is a declarative language?</b>
<p><i>A <a href="http://www.cs.rochester.edu/u/www/courses/108/glossary/Declarative_Language.html">declarative
language</a> is a language in which you describe the problem you are working
on and the computer decides how to solve it. Lisp and Prolog are declarative
languages.</i>
<p><i>On the other hand a <a href="http://www.cs.rochester.edu/u/www/courses/108/glossary/Prodedural_Language.html">procedural
language</a> is a language in which you tell the computer what to do. The
machine will then do what you tell it and you hope that what it tells you
is the answer to the question you wanted to ask. Pascal is a procedural
language.</i>
<p>These definitions should be treated with the deepest suspicion. They
claim to partition all programming languages into two discrete sets: either
100% abstract or 0% abstract. In practice, no language (with the exception
of assemblers) fits into either of these categories - they all lie somewhere
between the two extremes. However, there's no denying that some languages
permit and encourage a higher level of abstraction than others, and that
Lisp and Prolog <u>are</u> more abstract than - say - Pascal or C.
<p>One aim of this course is to convey the extent that abstractions can
take the agony out of programming. We will illustrate it with examples
written in Common Lisp (and the second course aim is to teach Lisp). And
even though in years to come you may not always find yourself at liberty
to write all your applications in Lisp, many of the concepts covered here
apply equally to lower level languages. Lisp encourages good programming
style, but having learned about style there's no excuse not to apply it
elsewhere. Therefore, we will attempt not to mention the word <i>declarative</i>
too often, and will think of this course as more properly titled:
<center><b><font size=+3>Lisp and elements of style.</font></b></center>

<p><b>1.2 Brief history of Lisp</b>
<p>Lisp (the acronym stands for LISt Processor) is the second oldest programing
language still in use (after FORTRAN), invented by John McCarthy at MIT
in 1958. For many years it could only be run on special purpose and rather
expensive hardware, such as sold by Xerox, Texas Instruments and Symbolics.
In more recent years implementations have appeared on stock systems: initially
on unix workstations but more recently on PCs. Nowadays, you cannot buy
a PC which is too "small" to run a Lisp system.
<p>Until the mid '80s Lisp was more a family of dialects than a single
language. In 1986 an ANSI subcommittee was formed to standardize these
dialects into a single Common Lisp, the result being the first Object Oriented
language to become standardized, in 1994. Common Lisp is by no means the
only dialect still in use, or even the most widespread. But it is the most
powerful and has the advantage that once you understand Common Lisp it
is easy to adapt yourself to weaker dialects.

<center><i>(administrative interlude)</i></center>
<b>1.3 Administrative: Software</b>
<p>Of the Common Lisp vendors, only two major players remain on the field:
<a href="http://www.xanalys.com/software_tools/">Xanalys</a>
(business formerly run by <a href="http://www.harlequin.com/">Harlequin</a>)
and <a href="http://www.franz.com/">Franz</a>. (Many other, less commercial,
implementations do exist alongside them.) Both companies distribute "<i>Personal
Editions</i>" of their lisp products, for use on Windows 95 / 98 / NT and
on Linux platforms; these are all full implementations of the Common Lisp
standard, aimed in particular at the academic community, with certain restrictions
to encourage professionals to purchase the real thing.
<p>This lecture course used the Personal Edition of Xanalys' <i>LispWorks
for the Windows operating system</i> for its practical lab sessions. You
could use this or any other (full implementation of) Common Lisp for lerning
purposes, though I strongly recommend either Franz or Harlequin, and you
can do so on the operating system of your choice. Visit
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://www.franz.com/downloads/">http://www.franz.com/downloads/</a>
<br>&nbsp;and
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://www.lispworks.com/downloads/">http://www.xanalys.com/downloads/</a>
<p>The downloads are not small. For example, LispWorks downloads as two
10 MB files. Another useful source is <a href="http://burks.bton.ac.uk/burks/language/lisp/">the
BURKS CD</a>.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>1.4 Administrative: Sources of information - online</b>
<p>The best starting point is without doubt the web site of the Association
of Lisp Users:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://www.lisp.org/">http://www.lisp.org/</a>.
<br>You will find all manner of useful resources here: books, tutorials,
papers, history, software, background material.
<p>An HTML representation of the Common Lisp specification, known as the
<i>HyperSpec</i>
will be found at
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://www.lispworks.com/reference/HyperSpec/Front/index.htm">http://www.lispworks.com/reference/HyperSpec/Front/index.htm</a>
;
<br>a similar repreesntation is also available on the Franz site at
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://www.franz.com/support/documentation/6.0/ansicl/ansicl.htm">http://www.franz.com/support/documentation/6.0/ansicl/ansicl.htm</a>.
<p>If you are into newsgroups then try <a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?q=comp.lang.lisp">news:comp.lang.lisp</a>.
If you are totally stuck on some concept you may post there (and you will
generally get a useful answer or ten) but you <b>if you are a student asking
for help with a formal assigment then you must make this clear in your
posting.</b>. If you fail to do this then (a) you will be flamed by other
readers for what is considered to be a breach of netiquette and (b) you
will have me breathing down your neck (I subscribe to this group).
<p><b>1.5 Administrative: Sources of information - books</b>
<p>The recommended book is
<ul>
<li>
<i>ANSI Common Lisp</i> by Paul Graham, Prentice Hall 1996, ISBN 0133708756,
&pound;31.&nbsp; This is an excellent and thorough introduction to the
language including a full (though somewhat abbreviated) reference manual.</li>
</ul>
Other books which may be useful for reference / background reading are
<ul>
<li>
<i>Common Lisp: the language</i> by Guy L Steele, <b>second edition</b>,
Digital Press 1990, ISBN 1555580416, &pound;34:54 from Amazon. This is
absolutely not an introductory text, but it does go into very useful depth
about every aspect of the language and is sometimes a good place to go
when you're stuck with some concept, or when you need a full explanation
of how something works. Almost as thorough as the formal specification
but considerably chattier and with a few good jokes. Warning: this book
was published 4 years before Common Lisp was standardized, and is thus
only a 99% match to the language, but that should be good enough for our
purposes.</li>

<ul>
<li>
The complete text of this book is supposed to be available online at <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/Groups/AI/html/cltl/cltl2.html">http://www.cs.cmu.edu/Groups/AI/html/cltl/cltl2.html</a>.
Last time I checked some of the links here were broken, but some of the
mirror sites are in better condition. You mileage may vary.</li>
</ul>

<li>
<i>LISP</i> by Patrick Winston and Berthold Horn, Addison-Wesley 1989,
ISBN 0201083191, &pound;36.99 from Amazon. Covers basic concepts but then
wanders off into heavily AI-based examples. Not a tutorial.</li>

<li>
<i>Paradigms of Artificial Intelligence: case studies in common Lisp</i>
by Peter Norvig, Morgan Kauffman 1992, ISBN 1558601910, &pound;39:45 from
Amazon.&nbsp; Deals with fairly advanced topics in AI.</li>
</ul>
Two books of note on <i>CLOS</i> (the Common Lisp Object System) are
<ul>
<li>
<i>Object Oriented Programming in Common Lisp: A Programmers Guide to the
Common Lisp Object System</i> by Sonya E. Keene, Addison-Wesley 1988, ISBN
0201175894, &pound;25:81 from Amazon. Extremely well written basic introduction
for CLOS beginners.</li>

<li>
<i>The Art of the Metaobject Protocol</i> by Gregor Kiczales, Jim Des Rivieres
&amp; Daniel G. Bobrow, MIT Press 1991, ISBN 0262610744, &pound;28:56 from
Amazon. In-depth look "under the hood" - everything you always wanted to
know about how an object system is built but were afraid someone might
answer.</li>
</ul>
In general, be wary of any Lisp book which does not explicitly apply to
"Common Lisp".

<b>1.7 Practical Session - Familiarity with LispWorks</b>
<p><b>1.7.1 Starting Lisp</b>
<p>The software we are running at Anglia is the Personal Edition of LispWorks
version 4.1.0. This is free software from Xanalys. The product runs on
Windows 95, 98 and NT 4.
<p>To start a lisp session, select the following item under Programs on
your Start menu:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Harlequin LispWorks
4.1 \ Personal Edition \ LispWorks
<p>There will be a short delay while the lisp system initializes itself.
You will eventually be left with three windows on-screen. On top is a nagware
window titled "Upgrade to LispWorks Professional Edition" which you need
to dismiss by clicking on "OK". Underneath that is a small window (the
"podium"), titled "LispWorks Personal Edition 4.1.0" and - somewhat larger
- a window titled "Listener 1". This last will be referred to in these
notes as "the listener".
<p>Do not attempt to close the podium; you might lose your entire lisp
session. Note that if you iconise the podium you will find all your other
lisp windows also iconised. (If this happens simply bring back the listener
from the task bar.) Hint: just leave the podium alone.
<p>Bring the listener to the top and make it large (e.g. maximize it).
<p>Incidentally, if you succeed in accidentally closing the listener, you
can create a new one by going to the Tools menu on the podium.
<p><b>1.7.2 On-line documentation</b>
<p>LispWorks comes with complete on-line documentation, in html form. This
includes an html representation of the ANSI specification for Common Lisp.
The full documentation takes up roughly 200 MB on the hard disk and it
may not be possible to for me to install it on the machines available for
these practical sessions. If this turns out to be the case and if you wish
to access on-line documentation during these sessions, you will need to
purchase and bring with you a copy of Xanalys' "Software tools sampler"
CD. To use it, simply insert the CD into your machine and kill any application
which autostarts on you. The lisp software will then be able to access
documentation as-and-when you need it.
<p>To access the documentation, either go to:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Harlequin LispWorks
4.1 \ Personal Edition \ Browsable Documentation
<br>under Programs on your Start menu, or select
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Help \ Manuals ...
<br>on the podium, or use the editor key binding Ctrl+Shift+D.
<p><b>1.7.3 The LispWorks Editor</b>
<p>The editor is driven by EMACS-style key bindings. These are not the
same as standard Windows bindings, and there are some subtle differences
in the style of interaction. In particular be aware that selecting a swathe
of text and then typing will not delete that text.
<p>Roughly:
<ul>
<li>
all the keys to the right of the keyboard (cursor keys, home, delete, page
up, etc.) do work as you would expect</li>

<li>
the standard Windows control-key bindings (e.g. Ctrl+C for copy) are not
in effect</li>

<li>
there are however roughly 200 key bindings (depending on context) in effect
in any editor window, which is too many to learn at one go</li>
</ul>
A <a href="../additional/key-binds.html">separate sheet</a> is available
listing a few of the most useful key bindings. Please ask if you suspect
there should be a keyboard shortcut for some frequent gesture, but you
don't know what it is.
<p>The listener, which you will use for direct interaction with the lisp
system, uses the editor key bindings plus some extras.
<p><b>1.7.4 Pauses and limitations</b>
<p>You will occasionally note that the system is somewhat sluggish in its
response. This can be for one of two reasons
<ul>
<li>
Paging delay. On a 32 MB machine running small lisp programs this should
not be too much of a problem, but you may notice it occasionally. For example,
first time a lisp session signals an error you will experience a few seconds
delay.</li>

<li>
Garbage collection: The lisp system will occasionally stop interacting
with you and "go away" for a couple of seconds while it scavenges for spare
memory. The cursor will change for the duration of this process.</li>
</ul>
We are using a free software here. To be more precise, this is a free edition
of a commercial product. The vendor has limited a few aspects of the software,
in particular:
<ul>
<li>
memory allocation (this should not be a problem for any of the work required
by this course)</li>

<li>
duration (5 hours maximum)</li>
</ul>
You will be warned before you hit either limit. I recommend that you save
your work and quit the image very soon after receiving the warning, because
if either of the above limits are actually exceeded, then the image will
halt abruptly and you will have no opportunity to save any work.
<p>In any case, you can restart lisp immediately, reload your work, and
continue where you left off.

</ul>
<b>1.9 Early mistakes</b>
<ul>
<li>
&nbsp;Hoping that an argument list will destructure for you, or trying
to give argument types to a function:</li>

<ul>&nbsp;<tt>(defun foo (list a b)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ....)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
; hopes to peel a and b out of a list</tt></ul>

<li>
Using a C-like calling syntax:</li>

<ul><tt>foo(a b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
; should be (foo a b)</tt></ul>

<li>
Parentheses around variables:</li>

<ul><tt>(foo (a) (b))&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ;
should be (foo a b)</tt></ul>

<li>
Parentheses around strings:</li>

<ul><tt>("hello")&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
; should be "hello"</tt></ul>

<li>
Not quoting when you need to suspend evaluation:</li>

<ul><tt>(98 99 100)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
; attempts to call function called 98</tt>
<br><tt>'(98 99 100)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
; a list containing three numbers</tt></ul>

<li>
Trying an "else" in (if ...)</li>

<ul><tt>(if (foo)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (bar)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; else (baz))&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
; drop the "else"!</tt></ul>
