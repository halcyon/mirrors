<p><b>Purpose: Structures, a word about macros, functions of functions,
anonymous functions</b>
<p><b>7.1 Structures</b>
<p>And so on to user-defined structures. An example:
<blockquote><tt>(defstruct point</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; x</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; y</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; z)</tt></blockquote>
This form is equivalent to a struct declaration in C. It defines a new
type, called point, with three <i>slots</i> (or <i>fields</i> if that's
a word you're happier with) called <tt>x</tt>, <tt>y</tt> and <tt>z</tt>.
<p>The <tt>defstruct</tt> macro gives us all of the following:
<ul>
<li>
A function <tt>make-point</tt>, which takes keyword arguments <tt>:x :y</tt>
and <tt>:z</tt> (all defaulting to <tt>nil</tt> if not supplied). Every
time you call this function a new <tt>point</tt> is constructed and returned
to you.</li>

<li>
Any object returned by <tt>make-point </tt>will be of type <tt>point</tt>,
and will respond enthusiastically to the predicate <tt>point-p</tt>.</li>

<li>
Setfable accessors <tt>point-x point-y </tt>and <tt>point-z</tt> can be
used to read and modify the slots of any <tt>point</tt> object.</li>
</ul>
Structures can have any number of slots (from zero up) and - as with lists
and general vectors - the slots can hold any values. By default (but see
below) structures print out using the slightly baroque <tt>#s</tt> syntax,
and can even be read back in that way; in fact what it boils down to is
that there are a lot of (some wierd, some useful) features in <tt>defstruct</tt>
but we aren't going to go into them here. [I'll just mention that if you
want to generate a structure type that inherits from another one, look
up the <tt>:include</tt> option to <tt>defstruct</tt> to see how it's done.]
<p>Example:
<blockquote><tt>CL-USER 53 > (defstruct point</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
x</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
y</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
z)</tt>
<br><tt>POINT</tt>
<p><tt>CL-USER 54 > (defun distance-from-origin (point)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(let* ((x (point-x point))</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(y (point-y point))</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(z (point-z point)))</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(sqrt (+ (* x x) (* y y) (* z z)))))</tt>
<br><tt>DISTANCE-FROM-ORIGIN</tt>
<p><tt>CL-USER 55 > (defun reflect-in-y-axis (point)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(setf (point-y point)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(- (point-y point))))</tt>
<br><tt>REFLECT-IN-Y-AXIS</tt>
<p><tt>CL-USER 56 > (setf my-point (make-point :x 3 :y 4 :z 12))</tt>
<br><tt>#S(POINT X 3 Y 4 Z 12)</tt>
<p><tt>CL-USER 57 > (type-of my-point)</tt>
<br><tt>POINT</tt>
<p><tt>CL-USER 58 > (distance-from-origin my-point)</tt>
<br><tt>13.0</tt>
<p><tt>CL-USER 59 > (reflect-in-y-axis my-point)</tt>
<br><tt>-4</tt>
<p><tt>CL-USER 60 > my-point</tt>
<br><tt>#S(POINT X 3 Y -4 Z 12)</tt>
<p><tt>CL-USER 61 ></tt></blockquote>
Finally: it quite often happens (when you have structures containing structures
containing ... etc.) that it all gets a bit much when it is printed out.
We will touch on this briefly later in the course, but for now note that
you can control how each type of structure prints. Just be aware that it
is possible to control this, and that by convention the output is typically
wrapped in <tt>#&lt;&nbsp; ></tt>. The reason for this is that the lisp
reader is programmed to signal an error whenever it sees
<tt>#&lt;</tt>
and so you can guarantee that once you've abandoned the baroque but re-readable
<tt>#s</tt>
syntax, your output can never be inadvertently re-read into the image.
<blockquote><tt>CL-USER 10 > (make-point :z 2 :x 0 :y 1)</tt>
<br><tt>#&lt;A point whose x,y,z co-ordinates are 0,1,2></tt>
<p><tt>CL-USER 11 > #&lt;A point whose x,y,z co-ordinates are 0,1,2></tt>
<p><tt>Error: </tt>(etc)</blockquote>

<p><br><b>7.2 Defining macros / expanding macros</b>
<p>You may have noticed that a growing number of the macros we have met:
<blockquote><tt>defun</tt>
<br><tt>defparameter</tt>
<br><tt>defconstant</tt>
<br><tt>defstruct</tt>
<br>(and more to come)</blockquote>
have a something in common. They are known as <i>defining macros</i> (they
define global functions, global parameters, constants, structure types,
and so on) and by convention these macros - and no others - start with
the letters <tt>"def"</tt>.
<p>You may also have noticed me repeatedly telling you that a macro is
<u>always</u>
shorthand for some other, typically longer and nastier, piece of code.
If curiosity bites, you can see for yourself what a macro call is going
to expand to by throwing it at the function <tt>macroexpand-1</tt>. An
example:
<blockquote><tt>(macroexpand-1 '(and foo bar))) => (if foo (and bar) nil)</tt></blockquote>
A slightly hairier example, in which we see that many macros expand into
all sorts of mean nasty things that we never wanted to know about. Note
the use of the function <tt>pprint</tt> which is like <tt>print</tt> except
that it attempts (with varying degrees of success) to respect your screen
width, indentation conventions, etc.
<blockquote><tt>CL-USER 3 > (pprint (macroexpand-1 '(defun foo (x) x)))</tt>
<p><tt>(TOP-LEVEL-FORM FOO</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; (DSPEC:DEFUN-AUX 'FOO</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
#'(LAMBDA</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(X)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(DECLARE (LAMBDA-NAME FOO))</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(BLOCK FOO X))))</tt>
<p><tt>CL-USER 4 ></tt></blockquote>
If you think that's ugly, try macroexpanding a <tt>defstruct</tt> form,
such as <tt>(defstruct foo bar)</tt>.
<p>System macros (i.e. macros, such as <tt>defun</tt>, which you didn't
define yourself) are not obliged to expand into anything you can read or
understand, or even into standard Common Lisp. The first of the above examples
did expand into code which is readable, comprehensible and still Common
Lisp; the second is part-way readable but goes "under the hood" with (e.g.)
<tt>DSPEC:DEFUN-AUX</tt>
which we know from nothing; and <tt>defstruct</tt> is always revolting.
<p>How system macros expand will typically differ between implementations,
e.g. between Xanalys and Franz, or between Franz on the PC and Franz on
Sun workstations.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>7.3 Functions as arguments to other functions</b>
<p>We saw in lecture 5 how you can pass the name of a function to <tt>mapcar</tt>
(and to other functions), for instance:
<blockquote><tt>CL-USER 11 > (mapc 'print '(foo bar baz))</tt>
<p><tt>FOO</tt>
<br><tt>BAR</tt>
<br><tt>BAZ</tt>
<br><tt>(FOO BAR BAZ)</tt>
<p><tt>CL-USER 12 ></tt></blockquote>
Functions which mess with other functions are very much part of the scenery
in lisp. Let's take look at just a couple of these...
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>7.4 Sorting things</b>
<p>The function <tt>sort</tt> takes a sequence and sorts it. Into ascending
numerical order? descending? alphabetical? or what? - Well that depends
on you: <tt>sort</tt> takes a second argument, a predicate (which we remember
is a function called to in order to obtain <i>false</i> or <i>true</i>,
i.e. a <tt>nil</tt> or non-<tt>nil</tt> answer), and this predicate is
used to determine the ordering. When <tt>sort</tt> has finished, each pair
of adjacent elements in the result has to satisfy our predicate.
<p>For instance, suppose we want to sort some list of numbers such as <tt>(14
40 16 8 35 33)</tt> into ascending order, i.e. into a sequence such that
<tt>&lt;</tt>
is true of each pair of adjacent numbers. We already have
<tt>(&lt; 14
40)</tt> and so these two numbers are in the right order. But <tt>(&lt;
40 16)</tt> is false, and so these two numbers need to be swapped around.
And so on...
<p>Example:
<blockquote><tt>CL-USER 36 > (defun lottery-choices-brute-force ()</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(let* ((fourty-nines '(49 49 49 49 49 49))</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(randoms-0-to-48 (mapcar 'random fourty-nines))</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(randoms-1-to-49 (mapcar '1+ randoms-0-to-48)))</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(sort randoms-1-to-49 '&lt;)))</tt>
<br><tt>LOTTERY-CHOICES-BRUTE-FORCE</tt>
<p><tt>CL-USER 37 > (lottery-choices-brute-force)</tt>
<br><tt>(8 14 16 33 35 40)</tt>
<p><tt>CL-USER 38 ></tt></blockquote>
The function <tt>random</tt> takes one argument - a positive integer or
float - and returns a pseudo-random number, non-negative but less than
the argument and of the same type - examples might be:
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (random 2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; =>&nbsp; 0</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (random 2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; =>&nbsp; 1</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (random 2.0)&nbsp; =>&nbsp; 1.2822167692131117</tt>
<p>The first call to <tt>mapcar</tt> above results in six random numbers,
each in the range 0...48. The UK lottery only accepts numbers from 1...49,
hence the second <tt>mapcar</tt> to adjusts the values. The call to <tt>sort</tt>
takes our numbers and sorts them into ascending numerical order.
<p>Another example - sorting words into alphabetical order:
<blockquote><tt>CL-USER 51 > (pprint (sort (vector "This" "is" "what" "I"
"typed" "to"</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"generate" "a" "string" "which"</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"read-line" "returned.")</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
'string-lessp))</tt>
<p><tt>#("a" "generate" "I" "is" "read-line" "returned." "string" "This"
"to"</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; "typed" "what" "which")</tt>
<p><tt>CL-USER 52 ></tt></blockquote>
[Note the use of <tt>string-lessp</tt> (case-insensitive) here. To get
case-sensitive ordering, in which the capitalized words would come at the
head of the result, we can use the predicate <tt>string&lt;</tt>. Don't
bother to learns all these case-insensitive variations - if you ever need
to use them for real you can look them up.]
<p>One further example:
<blockquote><tt>CL-USER 52 > (sort</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(copy-seq</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"This is what I typed to generate a string which read-line returned.")</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
'char&lt;)</tt>
<br><tt>"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -.ITaaaacdddeeeeeeeegghhhhiiiiilnnnnoprrrrrsssttttttuwwy"</tt>
<p><tt>CL-USER 53 ></tt></blockquote>
Note that in all these cases, <tt>sort</tt> has returned a sequence of
the same type (list, vector or string) as the original.
<p><b>WARNING! sort is a destructive function and will almost certainly
mangle the input sequence beyond recognition. Never ever sort a program
literal (e.g. anything you </b><tt>quote</tt><b>d, or built with </b><tt>#()</tt><b>
or with </b><tt>"..."</tt><b>). In each case above, I knew I had a freshly
created sequence to play with, whether generated by </b><tt>mapcar</tt><b>,
</b><tt>vector</tt><b>,
or </b><tt>copy-seq</tt><b> (which will take any sequence and produce a
fresh copy of it). Look what happens if you destructively modify a literal:</b>
<blockquote><tt>CL-USER 57 > (symbol-name 'copy-list)</tt>
<br><tt>"COPY-LIST"</tt>
<p><tt>CL-USER 58 > (sort (symbol-name 'copy-list) 'char&lt;)</tt>
<br><tt>"-CILOPSTY"</tt>
<p><tt>CL-USER 59 > 'copy-list</tt>
<br><tt>COMMON-LISP::-CILOPSTY</tt>
<p><tt>CL-USER 60 > ;; oops, probably time to quit this lisp session ;-(</tt></blockquote>

<p><br><b>7.5 Reducing a sequence</b>
<p>The function <tt>reduce</tt> takes (in the simplest case) a function
and a sequence. It uses this function first to combine the first two elements
of the sequence, then to combine the result with the third element, then
to combine this latest result with the fourth element, and so on until
the whole sequence has been processed.
<p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (reduce '+ '(1 2 3 4 5 6 7))&nbsp; =>&nbsp;&nbsp;
28</tt>
<p>This works by adding 1 to 2, adding 3 to the result, adding 4 to that,
etc.
<blockquote><tt>CL-USER 8 > (defun combine-2-strings (string1 string2)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(format nil "~a ~a" string1 string2))</tt>
<br><tt>COMBINE-2-STRINGS</tt>
<p><tt>CL-USER 9 > (defun combine-strings (strings)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(reduce 'combine-2-strings strings))</tt>
<br><tt>COMBINE-STRINGS</tt>
<p><tt>CL-USER 10 > (combine-strings #("This" "is" "what" "I" "typed" "to"</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"generate" "a" "string" "which"</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"read-line" "returned."))</tt>
<br><tt>"This is what I typed to generate a string which read-line returned."</tt>
<p><tt>CL-USER 11 ></tt>
<br>&nbsp;</blockquote>
<b>7.6 Throw-away functions</b>
<p>In the last example, I wrote a two line function (<tt>combine-2-strings</tt>)
whose sole purpose was to be passed to <tt>reduce</tt>. Now, it often happens
that you write a quickie like this, which will only be called from one
place and which belongs to it to such an extent that you would rather not
see them separately.
<blockquote><tt>(defun combine-strings (strings)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; (reduce (lambda (string1 string2)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(format nil "~a ~a" string1 string2))</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; strings))</tt></blockquote>
Please do not panic.
<ul>
<li>
The <tt>lambda</tt> means "build me a function which doesn't have a name"
[an <i>anonymous</i> function].</li>

<li>
You then get the argument list and body of the function in the usual way.</li>
</ul>
Another example:
<blockquote><tt>(defun lottery-choices-lambda ()</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; (let* ((fourty-nines '(49 49 49 49 49 49))</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (randoms (mapcar
(lambda (x)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(1+ (random x)))</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
fourty-nines)))</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (sort randoms '&lt;)))</tt></blockquote>
... although I have to admit that all these <tt>mapcar</tt>s look a little
out of place here and quite frankly
<blockquote><tt>(defun lottery-choices-dotimes ()</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; (let* ((randoms nil))</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (dotimes (i 6)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (push (1+ (random 49)) randoms))</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (sort randoms '&lt;)))</tt></blockquote>
would have been cleaner.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>7.7 Hash-quote</b>
<p>In the literature (and in many people's code) you will find <tt>lambda</tt>
forms prefixed by the syntax <tt>#'</tt>, for example:
<p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (mapcar #'(lambda (x) (1+ (random x))) fourty-nines)</tt>
<p>instead of
<p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (mapcar (lambda (x) (1+ (random x))) fourty-nines)</tt>
<p>The simplest suggestion I can make [rather than pinning your ears back
and making you listen to the full explanation] is that these two forms
are identical.
<p>You will also sometimes see <tt>#'</tt> before a symbol, denoting that
the associated function is wanted, typically when passing an argument to
<tt>mapcar</tt>,
<tt>reduce</tt>
etc. In these cases, you can [for the purposes of this course] replace
the <tt>#'</tt> with an ordinary <tt>quote</tt> and everything will be
fine. For example:
<p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (reduce 'combine-2-strings strings)</tt>
<p>and
<p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (reduce #'combine-2-strings strings)</tt>
<p>are essentially identical.
<p><tt>#'</tt> always denotes a function.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>7.8 Practical session / Suggested activity</b>
<p>Suppose we have structure definition thus:
<ul><tt>(defstruct student</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; name</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; SID&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ; an integer</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; modules)</tt>
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
Start by creating an instance of this structure type "on the fly". Interrogate
its slot-values. Try setting them. Interrogate the slots again. Have you
got the hang of it yet?</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
Write a program to ask for and read in student names, and to build structures
of type <tt>student</tt> (leaving the <tt>modules</tt> field blank for
now). When the input is finished (you might for example let the user signal
that by typing in an "empty name"; the <tt>loop</tt> macro might be useful
to you so do feel free to ask about it), return the list of structures
you have generated, sorted by students' names into alphabetical order.
Try to find an excuse to use <tt>lambda</tt> here.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
Write a function to find the name of the student with a given SID.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
Now design and define a structure for modules and try enrolling students
onto a module. You can now write code to ask which modules a named student
is enrolled for, or which students have enrolled for a named module.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
If time permits, find some way of recording marks for modules which students
have already attempted. Use <tt>reduce</tt> to find the total number of
marks over all modules attempted by each student and hence the total marks
obtained by the student cohort. Use it agin to count how many modules were
attempted by the cohort, and hence give the average mark. Name the three
students who have the highest marks. Spot which lecturer fails most of
their students. Answer any other questions that might be of interest.</li>
</ul>

<p><br><b>7.9 Further reading &amp; exercises</b>
<ul>
<li>
Graham sections 2.14, 3.2, 3.3, 4.6, 4.7</li>

<li>
Graham page 80 questions 2 &amp; 3.</li>

<li>
Enthusiasts might like to attempt page 57 question 6.</li>

<li>
The lottery example above will occasionally generate sequences in which
one or more of the numbers are repeated. Fix this.</li>

<li>
Rewrite functions <tt>better-maximum</tt> (section 4.11) and <tt>dotty</tt>
(section 5.7) in the form of a single function definition and an imbeded
<tt>lambda</tt>,
i.e. in the style of <tt>lottery-choices-lambda</tt> above.</li>

<li>
Suppose by some ghastly misunderstanding there was a lisp where the implementers
had forgotten to include the type <tt>cons</tt> or any operations based
on it. Use <tt>defstruct</tt> to define a structure of type <tt>my-cons</tt>.
Implement enough of the basics (<tt>my-first</tt>,&nbsp; <tt>my-rest</tt>
and <tt>cons</tt> at the very least) to prove that the concept works. How
would you build lists? Can you use <tt>nil</tt> to terminate them or do
you need to do something different (eg a <tt>my-nil</tt>)? Have a go at
<tt>my-length</tt>.</li>

<li>
Complete section 7.7 if you haven't already done so.</li>
