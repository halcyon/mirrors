<p><b>3.1 Review - statement of lisp evaluation rules</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER=10 COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" >
<tr>
<td>By <i>evaluate</i> we mean different things for different lisp forms...
<ul>
<li>
To evaluate a <i>self-evaluating object</i> such as a number or a string,
simply return the value of that number or string. So:</li>

<ul>
<li>
<tt>3.141592653589793 => 3.141592653589793</tt></li>

<li>
<tt>"Hi Nick" => "Hi Nick"</tt></li>
</ul>

<li>
To evaluate a symbol, use the value associated with that symbol. So:</li>

<ul>
<li>
a symbol used to name an argument to a function behaves as a program variable
in the obvious way. For example, if we have</li>

<ul>
<li>
<tt>(defun wombat (this that other) ...)</tt></li>

<li>
<tt>(wombat "foo" "bar" "wibble")</tt></li>
</ul>
then within the body of the function <tt>wombat</tt>, the variable <tt>this</tt>
has value <tt>"foo"</tt>,&nbsp; and so on.
<li>
some symbols have globally accessible, <i>constant </i>(meaning: you aren't
allowed to change them) values:</li>

<ul>
<li>
<tt>nil&nbsp; =>&nbsp; nil</tt></li>

<li>
<tt>t&nbsp; =>&nbsp; t</tt></li>

<li>
<tt>pi&nbsp; => 3.141592653589793</tt></li>
</ul>
</ul>

<li>
To evaluate a list</li>

<ul>
<li>
If it is a function call then evaluate each of its arguments, in order,
and call the function with the results of these evaluations. The result
of the evaluation is whatever value the function returns. So far we have
met the following functions:</li>

<ul>
<li>
<tt>+ - * / =&nbsp;</tt></li>

<li>
<tt>list first second ... tenth rest</tt></li>

<li>
<tt>identity</tt></li>

<li>
<tt>float</tt></li>
</ul>

<li>
If it is not a function call, we treat it specially, according to the idiosyncratic
definition of that particular non-function. Examples of non-functions include:</li>

<ul>
<li>
<tt>quote </tt>(suspends function evaluation)</li>

<li>
<tt>defun </tt>(defines new functions)</li>

<li>
<tt>if </tt>(conditional evaluation)</li>
</ul>
For example, <tt>if</tt> has syntax <tt>(if condition then-form else-form)</tt>.
(Actually the <tt>else-form</tt> is optional.) It always evaluates the
first subform <tt>condition</tt>. If that is true (i.e. non-<tt>nil</tt>)
then the second subform <tt>then-form</tt> is evaluated and the resulting
value returned by <tt>if</tt>; otherwise the third subform <tt>else-form</tt>
- if supplied - is used. So
<ul><tt>(if nil</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (hideous-disaster)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; "success")</tt></ul>
is quite safe.</ul>
</ul>

<p><b>3.2 Review - anatomy of a function call</b>
<p>Please do not hold your breath for the entire duration of this section...
<p>We are going to revise the story so far by looking at the simple lisp
session below and examining each step in minute detail.
<blockquote><tt>CL-USER 1 > (defun rev-list-of-2 (my-list)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(list (second my-list)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(first my-list)))</tt>
<br><tt>REV-LIST-OF-2</tt>
<p><tt>CL-USER 2 > (rev-list-of-2 '(foo bar))</tt>
<br><tt>(BAR FOO)</tt>
<p><tt>CL-USER 3 ></tt></blockquote>
We start by recalling the top-level <i>read-eval-print </i>loop, in which
lisp repeatedly performs the following tasks:
<ol>
<li>
print a prompt</li>

<li>
read a lisp form</li>

<li>
evaluate that form</li>

<li>
print the result</li>
</ol>
So, the lisp system starts by printing the first prompt <tt>CL-USER 1 ></tt>
and waits for a complete lisp form to be typed in. It then reads in the
complete form
<tt>(defun ...)</tt> and proceeds to evaluate it. Since <tt>defun</tt>
is not a function it is handled specially, which means here that we are
going to define a new function, in this case called <tt>rev-list-of-2</tt>.
The name of the function is returned by <tt>defun</tt> to the top-level
loop, this return value is printed out and a new prompt <tt>CL-USER 2 ></tt>
is issued.
<p>We recklessly decide&nbsp; to call our function with some test data.
Looking at the function definition, we can see that it takes precisely
one argument, named here <tt>my-list</tt>, and (given that we are handing
that value on to functions like <tt>first</tt>) this argument has to be
a list. The list we want to use for test data has two members: <tt>foo</tt>
and <tt>bar</tt>. How do we construct this list? Several suggestions come
to mind, but not all of them work:
<ul>
<li>
Using <tt>quote</tt> is easiest:</li>

<ul><tt>'(foo bar)</tt></ul>
This form evaluates to <tt>(foo bar)</tt>
<li>
If we fail to supply the quote</li>

<ul><tt>(foo bar)</tt></ul>
we imply we want to call the function <tt>foo</tt> with argument <tt>bar</tt>
(itself to be evaluated). This is not what we wanted.
<li>
An alternative is to use the function <tt>list</tt>, but note that we have
to protect its arguments from evaluation:</li>

<ul><tt>(list 'foo 'bar)</tt></ul>

<li>
Or, we could wimp out and change the test data so that the elements of
the list are self-evaluating and therefore don't need to be quoted:</li>

<ul><tt>(list "foo" "bar")</tt></ul>
</ul>
Suppose (for the sake of argument) we go for the first option, and type
in the form
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (rev-list-of-2 '(foo
bar))</tt>
<br>Lisp reads this in and proceeds to evaluate it. It knows that <tt>rev-list-of-2</tt>
is a function, so the system has to evaluate all the arguments supplied,
before it can proceed with the function call. In this case there is one
argument, <tt>'(foo bar)</tt>, which evaluates to <tt>(foo bar)</tt>, and
so <tt>rev-list-of-2</tt> is called with <tt>my-list</tt> set to the list
<tt>(foo
bar)</tt>.
<p>The body of the function is the form <tt>(list (second my-list) (first
my-list))</tt>. We evaluate this by appealing yet again to the evaluation
rules above. <tt>list</tt> is a function, so we start by evaluating its
arguments. The first argument is the form <tt>(second my-list)</tt> - i.e.
a call to the function <tt>second</tt>. This call to <tt>second</tt> has
to (guess what!) evaluate its argument; the argument is the variable <tt>my-list</tt>
whose value is <tt>(foo bar)</tt> and so <tt>second</tt> is called with
argument <tt>(foo bar)</tt> and it duly returns the value <tt>bar</tt>.
Therefore the first of the two values which we are going to pass to the
function <tt>list</tt> is the symbol <tt>bar</tt>. Similarly the second
value passed to <tt>list</tt> is the symbol <tt>foo</tt>, and the call
to <tt>list</tt> returns the list
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (bar foo)</tt>
<br>which is finally printed out to the sound of massive celebrations by
all concerned.
<p>(Did you remember to keep breathing?)
<p><b>3.3 defun reconsidered</b>
<p>We recall that the syntax of defun is
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <tt>(defun name (arg-1 arg-2
...) form-1 form-2 ... form-n)</tt>
<br>where <tt>name</tt> is the name of the function, <tt>arg-1</tt> etc.
are the names corresponding to the arguments to that function, and <tt>form-1</tt>
etc. are the lisp forms to evaluate in order to process a call to that
function. The value returned by the final form <tt>form-n</tt> is the value
to be returned by the call to the function itself.
<p>Within the body of the function (i.e. during the evaluation of the forms
<tt>form-1
form-2 </tt>etc) the names <tt>arg-1 arg-2 </tt>etc. are available to you
as program variables. Their initial values are the results of evaluating
the arguments to the function; in lisp parlance we say that these variables
are <i>bound</i> to those values.
<p>So if we have
<blockquote><tt>(defun square (x)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; (* x x))</tt></blockquote>
then during a call <tt>(square (+ 1 1))</tt>, the variable <tt>x</tt> is
bound to the result of evaluating <tt>(+ 1 1)</tt>.
<p>The binding lasts only while the function is active. It ceases to exist
on exit from the function and is not visible in calls to subfunctions (<i>shallow
binding</i>); the following won't work...
<blockquote><tt>(defun foo (wombat)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; (bar))</tt>
<p><tt>(defun bar ()</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; wombat)</tt></blockquote>
(Question to check you're still awake: how would you get the variable <tt>wombat</tt>
into the function <tt>bar</tt>?)
<p><b>3.4 More variables still</b>
<p>OK, so we know how to create variables on entry to functions and how
to assign them values. Suppose we want to create further variables within
the body of a function? We can do this by means of the special operator
<tt>let*</tt>.
For example, instead of
<blockquote><tt>(defun add-one-and-square-it (x)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; (* (+ x 1) (+ x 1)))</tt></blockquote>
we could write
<blockquote><tt>(defun add-one-and-square-it (x)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; (let* ((x-plus-one (+ x 1)))</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (* x-plus-one x-plus-one)))</tt></blockquote>
The syntax of <tt>let*</tt> is
<p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (let* ((var-1 value-1)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (var-2
value-2)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ...)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; form-1</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; form-2</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ...</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; form-n)</tt>
<p>Each of the pairs <tt>(var-i value-i)</tt> represents a <i>variable
binding</i> - the expression <tt>value-i </tt>is evaluated and the variable
<tt>var-i
</tt>is
bound to that value. The bindings are done in order:
<ol>
<li>
evaluate <tt>value-1</tt></li>

<li>
bind <tt>var-1</tt></li>

<li>
evaluate <tt>value-2</tt></li>

<li>
bind <tt>var-2</tt></li>

<br>etc</ol>
and so on. (This means that, for example, you can use <tt>var-1</tt> in
the evaluation of <tt>value-2</tt>.) The bindings last until the end of
the <tt>let*</tt> statement, at which point <tt>let*</tt> returns the value
of the final form, <tt>form-n</tt>.
<p><b>3.5 Example - reading, writing and arithmetic</b>
<p>Let's trot out the example of converting temperatures from Fahrenheit
to Celsius. Rather than writing a function which takes one value and returns
another, i.e.
<blockquote><tt>CL-USER 18 > (defun simple-fahrenheit-to-celsius (fahrenheit)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(float (* (- fahrenheit 32) 5/9)))</tt>
<br><tt>SIMPLE-FAHRENHEIT-TO-CELSIUS</tt>
<p><tt>CL-USER 19 > (simple-fahrenheit-to-celsius 212)</tt>
<br><tt>100.0</tt>
<p><tt>CL-USER 20 > (simple-fahrenheit-to-celsius 32)</tt>
<br><tt>0.0</tt>
<p><tt>CL-USER 21 > ; very happy</tt></blockquote>
suppose that we have been asked to write a function which prompts the user
for a value, reads it in and prints the result.
<blockquote><tt>CL-USER 31 > (fahrenheit-to-celsius)</tt>
<br><tt>Please give a value in degrees F: 32</tt>
<br><tt>32 degrees F is 0.0 degrees C.</tt>
<br><tt>NIL</tt>
<p><tt>CL-USER 32 > ; etc</tt></blockquote>
We need the following functions to handle reading and printing of lisp
values:
<table CELLSPACING=15 WIDTH="100%" >
<tr ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP>
<td><tt>read</tt></td>

<td ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP>reads a lisp form and returns it. At its simplest,
a function of no arguments which reads from the listener. If no form has
been typed yet, <tt>read</tt> will sit and wait until a complete form is
available to it.</td>
</tr>

<tr VALIGN=TOP>
<td><tt>format&nbsp;</tt></td>

<td ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP>function for generating formatted output. First
argument is a destination. Specify
<ul>
<li>
<tt>nil </tt>for output to a string (like sprintf in C), which <tt>format</tt>
generates and returns.</li>

<li>
<tt>t </tt>for output to the listener (like printf in C), in which case
<tt>format</tt>
returns nil.</li>
</ul>
The next argument is known as the <i>format string</i>. In the same way
that printf handles specially any occurrence of the character <tt>%</tt>,
format handles specially any occurrence of the character <tt>~</tt> (pronounced
<i>tilde</i>).&nbsp;
In particular,
<ul>
<li>
<tt>~&amp;</tt> means: output a fresh line (i.e. if we weren't already
at the start of a line, output a new one)</li>

<li>
<tt>~a</tt> means: take the next of the arguments to <tt>format</tt> and
insert its printed representation here</li>
</ul>
Example: <tt>(let* ((name "Nick")) (format nil "Hello, ~a." name))&nbsp;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; =>&nbsp; "Hello, Nick."</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>And the function definition looks like this:
<blockquote><tt>(defun fahrenheit-to-celsius ()</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; (format t "~&amp;Please give a value in degrees F: ")</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; (let* ((fahrenheit (read))</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (celsius (float
(* (- fahrenheit 32) 5/9))))</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (format t "~&amp;~a degrees F is ~a degrees
C.~&amp;" fahrenheit celsius)))</tt></blockquote>

<p><br><b>3.6 Further example - quadratic equations</b>
<p>If a quadratic equation is something you "know from nothing", don't
panic. All we want to do is define a function of three numerical arguments
<tt>a</tt>,
<tt>b</tt>
and <tt>c</tt> which returns a list of the following two values:
<blockquote><img SRC="image-3-5.jpg" height=146 width=605></blockquote>

<blockquote>(assuming the square-root is possible - if it isn't we'll generate
an error instead).</blockquote>
Don't ask why, just assume your lecturer has acquired a passion for daft
formulae and let him get on with it.
<p>Anyway, this example introduces three new functions:
<br>&nbsp;
<table CELLSPACING=15 WIDTH="100%" >
<tr ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP>
<td><tt>&lt;</tt></td>

<td ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP>predicate which takes any number of (numerical)
arguments and returns <tt>t</tt> if they are all in strictly ascending
order. Otherwise it returns <tt>nil</tt>. So&nbsp;
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (&lt; 499 499.8 500 1000)&nbsp;
=> t</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (&lt; 1 2 3 4 6 5 7 8 9)&nbsp; =>
nil</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (&lt; 0 0)&nbsp; => nil</tt>
<br>While we're here, <tt>></tt> tests for descending order, and <tt>&lt;=</tt>
and <tt>>=</tt> are variants of <tt>&lt;</tt> and <tt>></tt>&nbsp; which
allow arguments which are <tt>=</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (>= 2 1 1 1 0 0)&nbsp; => t</tt></td>
</tr>

<tr VALIGN=TOP>
<td><tt>sqrt</tt></td>

<td ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP>function of one number which returns its square
root.</td>
</tr>

<tr ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP>
<td><tt>error</tt></td>

<td>function for flagging (<i>signalling</i>) errors. At its simplest,
it is happy with a single argument (a string) which will be printed out
as an error message.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>So here we go:
<blockquote><tt>(defun quadratic-solve (a b c)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; (let* ((discriminant (- (* b b) (* 4 a c))))</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (if (&lt; discriminant 0)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (error "Discriminant
was negative.")</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (list (/ (+ b (sqrt discriminant))</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(* -2 a))</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(/ (- b (sqrt discriminant))</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(* -2 a))))))</tt></blockquote>
or (imo better - why?)
<blockquote><tt>(defun quadratic-solve (a b c)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; (let* ((discriminant (- (* b b) (* 4 a c))))</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (if (&lt; discriminant 0)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (error "Discriminant
was negative.")</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (let* ((square-root (sqrt discriminant))</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(denominator (* -2 a)))</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (list (/ (+ b square-root)
denominator)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(/ (- b square-root) denominator))))))</tt></blockquote>

<p><br><b>3.7 Further Logic</b>
<p>Some of the examples below will need the following pair of macros.
<br>&nbsp;
<table CELLSPACING=15 WIDTH="100%" >
<tr ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP>
<td><tt>and</tt></td>

<td ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP>Takes any number of arguments. Evaluates them
in order until one returns <tt>nil</tt>, at which point <tt>and</tt> stops
evaluating things and returns
<tt>nil</tt>. If the last argument returns
non-<tt>nil</tt>, then <tt>and</tt> returns that value. Examples:
<ul>
<li>
<tt>(and 1 2 3 4 5)&nbsp; =>&nbsp; 5</tt></li>

<li>
<tt>(and 1 2 nil 4 5)&nbsp; =>&nbsp; nil</tt></li>

<li>
<tt>(and nil (global-meltdown))&nbsp; =>&nbsp; nil&nbsp; </tt>(without
the meltdown)</li>
</ul>
</td>
</tr>

<tr VALIGN=TOP>
<td><tt>or</tt></td>

<td ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP>Takes any number of arguments. Evaluates them
in order until one returns a non-<tt>nil</tt> value, at which point <tt>or</tt>
stops evaluating things and returns that value. If the last argument returns
<tt>nil</tt>,
then <tt>or</tt> returns <tt>nil</tt>. Examples:
<ul>
<li>
<tt>(or 1 2 3 4 5)&nbsp; =>&nbsp; 1</tt></li>

<li>
<tt>(or nil nil nil 4 nil 5 6 7)&nbsp; =>&nbsp; 4</tt></li>

<li>
<tt>(or nil (global-meltdown))&nbsp; =>&nbsp;&nbsp;</tt> some sort of regrettable
disaster</li>
</ul>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p><b>3.8 Practical Session</b>
<ol>
<li>
Lisp defines a function <tt>not</tt>, which maps <tt>nil</tt> to <tt>t</tt>
and any other value to <tt>nil</tt>.&nbsp; Define your own function (call
it <tt>my-not</tt>) which has this behaviour:</li>

<ol><tt>(my-not nil)&nbsp; =>&nbsp; t</tt>
<br><tt>(my-not <i>anything-else</i>)&nbsp; =>&nbsp; nil</tt></ol>
If this gives you any difficulty, start by defining a function which takes
one argument, returns <tt>t</tt> if the argument is non-<tt>nil</tt>, and
<tt>nil</tt>
if the argument is <tt>nil</tt>. Do not forget the equivalence between
the empty list, the symbol <tt>nil</tt> and logical falsehood.
<li>
Write:</li>

<ol TYPE=a>
<li>
A function of two arguments (both numbers) which finds the smallest. Test
carefully (e.g. if the numbers are equal does it still work?)</li>

<li>
(A little trickier...) Now do the same with three numbers (again test this
carefully).</li>
</ol>

<li>
Experiment to see what happens if you attempt to rebind a constant, both
by using it as the name for an argument to a function, and by using <tt>let*</tt>.</li>

<li>
Implement <tt>celsius-to-fahrenheit</tt>.</li>
</ol>

<p><br><b>3.9 Suggested activity / exercises etc</b>
<ol>
<li>
Go through the above notes and answer all the rhetorical questions.</li>

<li>
(Only try this one if you've met complex numbers in maths...) Take the
square-root of a negative number and see what happens. Note that what you
have in front of you is valid lisp as far as the reader is concerned (type
it back in to prove that). Now generate the square of that object. (Advanced
topic: Did you get back to where you started? Why / why not?)</li>

<li>
Why does the call to <tt>fahrenheit-to-celsius</tt> above print a <tt>NIL</tt>?</li>

<li>
We could have written</li>

<ol><tt>(defun fahrenheit-to-celsius ()</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; (format t "~&amp;Please give a value in degrees F: ")</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; (format t "~&amp;This is ~a degrees C.~&amp;"</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (float (*
(- (read) 32) 5/9))))</tt></ol>
but that would not have been as elegant a solution. Why?
<li>
On the other hand we might have taken this one step further and written</li>

<ol><tt>(defun fahrenheit-to-celsius ()</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; (format t "~&amp;Please give a value in degrees F: ~&amp;This
is ~a degrees C.~&amp;"</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (float (*
(- (read) 32) 5/9))))</tt></ol>
but that would not have worked properly. Why? (Guess before you try it
out.)
<li>
I mentioned in lecture 2 that <i>macros</i> work by transforming source
code into something more "fundamental" (albeit longer and less readable).
For example, we could transform the call</li>

<ol><tt>(and foo bar)</tt></ol>
into
<ol><tt>(if foo bar nil)</tt></ol>
Figure out, in terms of code which does not use any macros (hint: <tt>if</tt>
is not a macro, it's a special operator, so you can use it), what each
of the following could be transformed into:
<ol TYPE=a>
<li>
<tt>(and foo bar baz)</tt></li>

<li>
<tt>(or foo bar)&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt>(Answer not 100% obvious. See solutions
sheet now for hint.)</li>

<li>
<tt>(or foo bar baz)</tt></li>
</ol>

<li>
Now pick one of the above four examples (the hairiest you feel you can
cope with) and write code to do the transformation for you. E.g.</li>

<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (defun transform-and-with-2-args (form) ...)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (transform-and-with-2-args '(and foo bar))&nbsp;
=>&nbsp; (if foo bar nil)</tt>
<li>
Advanced topic for survivors of the quadratic equation example: implement
a function which solves simultaneous equations. I.e. given the numbers
<tt>a
b c d e f </tt>find a pair of numbers <tt>x</tt> and <tt>y</tt> which satisfy
the equations</li>

<ol><tt>ax + by = c&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt>and<tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
dx + ey = f</tt></ol>
You will have to test for one particular special case, to avoid division
by zero. (What happens if you don't?)</ol>
