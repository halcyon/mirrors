<p><b>Purpose: Evaluation rules and macros</b>
<p><b>11.1 Recall the evaluation rules for lists</b>
<p>We stated early on (section 3.1) that, to evaluate a list:
<ul>
<li>
if it is a function call then evaluate each of its arguments, in order,
and call the function with the results of these evaluations. The result
of the evaluation is whatever value the function returns.</li>

<li>
if it is not a function call, we treat it specially, according to the idiosyncratic
definition of that particular non-function.</li>
</ul>
We are now in a position to return to this subject and cover it more precisely,
recalling that there are two types of "not a function": macros and special
operators. They share the properties that:
<ul>
<li>
each of these operators has its own individual syntax and, in particular,</li>

<li>
they typically don't evaluate all their arguments</li>
</ul>
They differ in that:
<ul>
<li>
macros <u>always</u> "stand for" other code, so by <i>macroexpanding</i>
a macro call (possibly repeatedly) you can always get to the underlying
non macro form.</li>

<li>
special operators are implemented "under the hood" - there is no way to
"expand" a call to a special operator. [Not quite true - an implementation
is free to implement a special operator as a macro if it wants - it would
be more accurate for me to state that there is no guarantee that any special
operator will "expand". For example, none of the special operators in LispWorks
for Windows "expand".]</li>

<li>
you can define your own macros but the set of special operators is fixed.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;So why you should bother with macros?. The answer to this is that
macros result in code which is more:
<ul>
<li>
compact</li>

<li>
flexible</li>

<li>
natural / readable</li>

<li>
maintainable</li>

<li>
rapidly developed</li>
</ul>

<p><br><b>11.2 Review of special operators</b>
<p>Let's start with the special operators. There are 25 of these in the
language and there is no way to add more of your own. The function <tt>special-operator-p</tt>
called with one of these symbols returns true:
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (special-operator-p 'setq)&nbsp; =>&nbsp; <i>true</i></tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (special-operator-p 'setf)&nbsp; =>&nbsp; nil</tt>
<p>We have met the following 10 special operators so far:
<ul><tt>block</tt>
<br><tt>return-from</tt>
<br><tt>catch</tt>
<br><tt>throw</tt>
<br><tt>function</tt>
<br><tt>quote</tt>
<br><tt>if</tt>
<br><tt>let*</tt>
<br><tt>progn</tt>
<br><tt>unwind-protect</tt></ul>
The following 13 (of which the first 5 will be more useful to you over
the years than the rest) are outside the scope of this course:
<ul><tt>eval-when&nbsp; load-time-value&nbsp; locally&nbsp; the&nbsp; labels&nbsp;
flet&nbsp; macrolet&nbsp; symbol-macrolet&nbsp; go&nbsp; tagbody&nbsp;
progv&nbsp; multiple-value-call&nbsp; multiple-value-prog1</tt></ul>
That leaves two more which you might get by without ever using, but for
completeness I do need to mention them here briefly:
<ul>
<li>
<tt>setq</tt></li>

<br>This is equivalent to the macro <tt>setf</tt>, but can only be used
for setting a value into a variable / symbol. So <tt>(setf foo <i>some-value</i>)</tt>
can be rewritten <tt>(setq foo <i>some-value</i>)</tt>. A historical relic
which probably wouldn't be in the language at all if it had been designed
from scratch to support the more general purpose <tt>setf</tt>. Emacs lisp
has <tt>setq</tt> but does not support <tt>setf</tt>.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<tt>let</tt></li>

<br>This is similar to the special operator <tt>let*</tt> and has the same
syntax. The only difference between the two is that <tt>let*</tt> processes
its binding pairs in order (<i>sequentially</i>) but <tt>let</tt> processes
them simultaneously (<i>in parallel</i>). For example:
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (let* ((foo 99)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (bar
(1+ foo)))</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bar)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
=>&nbsp; 100</tt>
<br>but
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (let ((foo 99)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (bar (1+
foo)))</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bar)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
=>&nbsp; <i>error</i></tt>
<br>because <tt>let</tt> attempts to evaluate all the values in the variable-value
pairs, i.e. here the values <tt>99</tt> and <tt>(1+ foo)</tt>, <u>before</u>
it sets any of the results into either of the variables <tt>foo</tt> or
<tt>bar</tt>.
So <tt>(1+ foo)</tt> cannot be calculated, as <tt>foo</tt> isn't available
yet.
<p>I personally tend to use <tt>let</tt> in preference to <tt>let*</tt>
when there's only one binding pair, but this is purely a matter of style
and has absolutely no operational significance. When there are two or more
variables being bound, you will almost always get away with <tt>let*</tt>
(either because it doesn't matter in your case, or because - as above -
<tt>let</tt>
is wrong in your case).
<p>To my mind, <tt>let</tt> and <tt>let*</tt> are badly named (c.f. <tt>setf</tt>
and its parallel counterpart <tt>psetf</tt>).</ul>
<b>11.3 Back to macros (see also section 7.3)</b>
<p>In the course of the first ten lectures we have met a fair number of
lisp's 91 macros:
<blockquote><tt>and&nbsp; decf&nbsp; defconstant&nbsp; defparameter&nbsp;
defstruct&nbsp; defun&nbsp; dolist&nbsp; dotimes&nbsp; ignore-errors&nbsp;
incf&nbsp; lambda&nbsp; loop&nbsp; or&nbsp; pop&nbsp; prog1&nbsp; prog2&nbsp;
push&nbsp; pushnew&nbsp; return&nbsp; setf&nbsp; trace&nbsp; untrace&nbsp;
with-open-file</tt></blockquote>
Some are easily defined (e.g. <tt>and, return</tt>), others are more complex
in their behaviour (the defining macros, for instance), and several (<tt>push</tt>)
look OK from a distance but turn out to be slightly more fiendish when
you get close up. Today we will
<ul>
<li>
take a look at how some of the simpler macros expand</li>

<li>
introduce a few more</li>

<li>
see how to add more macros to the language</li>
</ul>
Let's start with a very simple example: the macro <tt>return</tt>. We recall
that this has syntax
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (return &amp;optional <i>what</i>)</tt>
<br>and that it is shorthand for / equivalent to invoking the special operator
<tt>return-from</tt>:
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (return <i>what</i>) ==&nbsp; (return-from nil
<i>what</i>)</tt>
<p>How is this equivalence managed?
<p>Lisp provides the following assistance:
<ul>
<li>
the function <tt>macro-function</tt>, which takes a symbol and returns
true if there is a macro associated with that symbol.</li>

<li>
the function <tt>macroexpand-1</tt>, which takes an entire lisp form and
runs the macro-expander associated with the <tt>car</tt> of that form,
if possible. It returns either the expanded form, or the original if no
expander was defined.</li>
</ul>
So:
<blockquote><tt>(macro-function 'return)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
=>&nbsp; <i>true</i></tt>
<br><tt>(macroexpand-1 '(return))&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
=>&nbsp; (return-from nil)</tt>
<br><tt>(macroexpand-1 '(return (foo bar))&nbsp; =>&nbsp; (return-from
nil (foo bar))</tt></blockquote>
The way you define this behaviour is via yet another (defining) macro:
<tt>defmacro</tt>.
For instance:
<blockquote><tt>(defmacro return (&amp;optional what)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; (list 'return-from nil what))</tt></blockquote>
To see how this works in practice, suppose we are running the following
code:
<blockquote><tt>(let ((count 0))</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; (dolist (element list)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (if (eq element thing)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (return count))</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (incf count)))</tt></blockquote>
and that we have arrived at the <tt>return</tt> form. The lisp system determines
(by calling <tt>special-operator-p</tt>) that <tt>return</tt> is not a
special operator. It then determines (by calling <tt>macro-function</tt>)
that <tt>return</tt> is a macro. The function <tt>macroexpand-1</tt> is
then called with the entire lisp form constituting the macro call as its
argument:
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (macroexpand-1 '(return count))</tt>
<br>That function invokes the macro definition for <tt>return</tt>, which
generates a list with three elements: the symbols <tt>return-from</tt>,
<tt>nil</tt>
and <tt>count</tt>. It has therefore effectively generated a new lisp form:
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (return-from nil count)</tt>
<br>and this is evaluated in place of the original form.
<p>You don't have to think all this through every time though. You can
just say: it's a macro, so the form will be replaced by whatever the macro
function expands it into.
<p>Macros transform lisp source into new code. To quote Graham:
<center>
<p><i>You define a macro by saying what a call should expand into.</i>
<br><i>Underneath, macros are just functions that return expressions.</i></center>

<p>Macros are an incredibly flexible and powerful way to expand the language.
They beat #define into a cocked hat. Effectively, macros are programs which
write more programs. They permit code which is compact, readable, maintainable.
And because macros use lisp syntax to transform lisp into more lisp, you
don't have to "leave the language" to use them.
<p><b>11.4 Conditionals: when, unless and cond</b>
<p>Another simple macro is <tt>when</tt>. This has syntax
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (when test-form form-1 form-2 ... form-n)</tt>
<br>which is equivalent to
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (if test-form (progn form-1 form-2 ... form-n))</tt>
<br>In other words, <tt>when</tt> evaluates its first form. If that is
non-<tt>nil</tt>, it evaluates all its remaining forms as an implicit <tt>progn</tt>
and returns the value of the final form, otherwise <tt>when</tt> simply
returns <tt>nil</tt>.
<p>So
<blockquote><tt>(if (char= next #\;)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (progn</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (setf previous-position position)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (incf count)))</tt></blockquote>
can be rewritten
<blockquote><tt>(when (char= next #\;)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; (setf previous-position position)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; (incf count))</tt></blockquote>
We can code its expander thus:
<blockquote><tt>(defmacro when (test-form &amp;rest forms)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; (list 'if</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; test-form</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (cons 'progn forms)))</tt></blockquote>
Note that this is getting a little difficult to read (and to code correctly!)
- you have to stop and think about when to use <tt>list</tt> and when to
use <tt>cons</tt>, and this is still a fairly simple example. The trick
is to use the backquote notation (section 4.5):
<blockquote><tt>(defmacro when (test-form &amp;rest forms)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; `(if ,test-form</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (progn ,@forms)))</tt></blockquote>
Macro writing now becomes a whole load easier, because you simply write
out the form you're trying to generate and place
<ul>
<li>
a backquote before the whole thing</li>

<li>
a comma before each form to be evaluated in the macro expander (we didn't
want the symbol <tt>test-form</tt> in the result - what we did want was
the lisp code associated with this variable)</li>

<li>
comma-at before each form to be evaluated and spliced in to the surrounding
list - typically you splice variables supplied to the macro by <tt>&amp;rest</tt>
and typically these are forms to be evaluated as as implicit <tt>progn</tt>.</li>
</ul>
Another example: the macro <tt>unless</tt> which is like <tt>when</tt>
but only runs the forms if the <tt>test-form</tt> evaluated to <tt>nil</tt>.
The following would both work as macro definitions for <tt>unless</tt>.
Note that one of them defines <tt>unless</tt> in terms of another macro
(<tt>when</tt>), so that a call involving <tt>unless</tt> would have to
be macroexpanded twice.
<blockquote><tt>(defmacro unless (test-form &amp;rest forms)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; `(if ,test-form</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nil</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (progn ,@forms)))</tt>
<p><tt>(defmacro unless (test-form &amp;rest forms)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; `(when (not ,test-form)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ,@forms))</tt></blockquote>
Finally in this section, the macro <tt>cond</tt> removes the need for vast
nested chains of <tt>if</tt> statements. The syntax is:
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (cond clause-1 clause-2 ... clause-n)</tt>
<br>where each clause looks like this:
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (test-form form-1 ... form-n)</tt>
<br>If the test in <tt>clause-1</tt> is true then all the subforms in that
clause are evaluated (implicit <tt>progn</tt>) and the value of the last
form returned. Otherwise the next clause is tried, and so on in order until
either one of the tests succeeds or they all fail.
<p>This definition suggests a recursive implementation:
<blockquote><tt>(defmacro cond (&amp;rest clauses)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; (when clauses</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (let* ((this (first clauses))</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (others
(rest clauses))</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (test
(first this))</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (forms
(rest this)))</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; `(if ,test</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (progn
,@forms)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (cond ,@others)))))</tt></blockquote>
but an iterative one will do too:
<blockquote><tt>(defmacro cond (&amp;rest clauses)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; (let ((expansion nil))</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (dolist (this (reverse clauses))</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (let ((test (first this))</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(forms (rest this)))</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (setf expansion</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
`(if ,test</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(progn ,@forms)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
,expansion))))</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; expansion))</tt></blockquote>
Using the first expansion,
<blockquote><tt>(cond (foo (bar) baz)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (wombat wibble)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (t 99))</tt></blockquote>
expands to
<blockquote><tt>(if foo</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (progn (bar) baz)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; (cond (baz wibble)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (t 99)))</tt></blockquote>
using the second we get
<blockquote><tt>(if foo</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (progn (bar) baz)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; (if wombat</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (progn wibble)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (if t</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (progn 99)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nil)))</tt></blockquote>
Assuming I haven't made any mistakes in this, the forms are equivalent
and either macro definition will do.
<p>As you can see, writing macros can very rapidly become a complex task.
However, the results tend to be rewarding, because the language is so much
more powerful for the presence of macros.
<p><b>11.5 Further examples of macros</b>
<ul>
<li>
<tt>case</tt></li>

<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;
<p>This has a syntax somewhat similar to <tt>cond:</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (case value clause-1 clause-2 ... clause-n)</tt>
<br>where each clause looks like this:
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (keys form-1 ... form-n)</tt>
<br>Each of the <tt>keys</tt> forms is a list of objects (not evaluated!).
If <tt>value</tt> is <tt>eq</tt> to any of the keys for <tt>clause-1</tt>
then that clause's subforms are evaluated in the usual way; otherwise we
try the next clause. The final clause may have one of the symbols <tt>t</tt>
or <tt>otherwise</tt> (it doesn't matter which) instead of a list of keys
- that means invoke this clause anyway if all else failed. Example:
<ul><tt>(defun decode (x)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; (case x</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ((i uno) 1)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ((ii dos) 2)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ((iii tres) 3)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ((iv cuatro) 4)))</tt>
<br><tt>(defun add-em (x) (reduce '+ (mapcar 'decode x)))</tt>
<p><tt>(add-em '(uno iii)) =>&nbsp; 4</tt></ul>

<p><br>Related macros include <tt>ecase</tt> which signals an error if
none of the keys are matched, and <tt>typecase</tt> (along with <tt>etypecase</tt>)
which dispatches on the type of <tt>value</tt>:
<ul><tt>(defun satisfy (requirement state)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; (etypecase requirement</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (symbol ...)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (string ...)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (cons ...)))</tt></ul>

<li>
<tt>shiftf </tt>and<tt> rotatef</tt></li>

<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;
<p>These two macros are probably more fun than use, except that <tt>rotatef</tt>
is dead handy for swapping values around.
<p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (shiftf place-1 place-2 ... place-n new-value)</tt>
<br>assigns the old value of <tt>place-2</tt> into <tt>place-1</tt>, the
old value of <tt>place-3</tt> into <tt>place-2</tt>, and so on to the end
where <tt>new-value</tt> is assigned to <tt>place-n</tt>. The old value
of <tt>place-1</tt> is returned.
<p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (rotatef place-1 place-2 ... place-n)</tt>
<br>assigns the old value of <tt>place-2</tt> into <tt>place-1</tt>, the
old value of <tt>place-3</tt> into <tt>place-2</tt>, and so on to the end
where the old value of <tt>place-1</tt> is assigned to <tt>place-n</tt>.
The return value is <tt>nil</tt>. In particular,
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (rotatef place-1 place-2)</tt>
<br>is equivalent to
<ul>&nbsp;
<br><tt>(let ((temp (place-1)))</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; (setf place-1 place-2</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; place-2 temp)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; nil)</tt></ul>

<li>
<tt>print-unreadable-object</tt></li>

<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;
<p>This macro has syntax:
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (print-unreadable-object (object stream &amp;key
type identity) forms) => nil</tt>
<br>It outputs a printed representation of <tt>object</tt> on <tt>stream</tt>,
beginning with <tt>"&lt;#"</tt> and ending with <tt>">"</tt>. Everything
output to <tt>stream</tt> by the body <tt>forms</tt> is enclosed in the
the angle brackets. If <tt>type</tt> is true, the output from <tt>forms</tt>
is preceded by a brief description of the <tt>object</tt>'s type and a
space character. If <tt>identity</tt> is true, the output from <tt>forms</tt>
is followed by a space character and a representation of the <tt>object</tt>'s
identity, typically a storage address.
<p>If either <tt>type</tt> or <tt>identity</tt> is not supplied, its value
defaults to <tt>nil</tt>. It is valid to omit the body <tt>forms</tt>.
If <tt>type</tt> and
<tt>identity</tt> are both true and there are no body
<tt>forms</tt>,
only one space character separates the type and the identity.
<p>In this example, the precise form of the output is implementation-dependent.
<pre>&nbsp;(defmethod print-object ((obj airplane) stream)
&nbsp;&nbsp; (print-unreadable-object (obj stream :type t :identity t)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (format stream "~a" (tail-number obj))))

&nbsp;(format nil "~a" my-airplane)
&nbsp;&nbsp; =>&nbsp; "#&lt;Airplane NW0773 36000123135>"
OR =>&nbsp; "#&lt;FAA:AIRPLANE NW0773 17>"</pre>
</ul>
<b>11.6 Revisiting the function evaluation rules</b>
<p>&nbsp;So, to evaluate a non empty list (seeing as the empty list is
identical to the self-evaluating symbol <tt>nil</tt>), we look at the <tt>first</tt>
element of that list.
<ol>
<li>
If it is a symbol which names one of the 25 special operators, carry out
the appropriate behaviour for that special operator.</li>

<li>
Otherwise, if it is a symbol which has a macro definition, expand that
macro and restart the evaluation (recursive loop!)</li>

<li>
Otherwise, we must have a function. This may be either a symbol which is
<tt>fboundp</tt>,
or a list of the form</li>

<ul><tt>(lambda (arg1 arg2 ...) ....)</tt></ul>
We evaluate each argument in turn (from "left to right") and call the function
with the results of these evaluations. The result of the evaluation is
whatever value the function returns. Example of this rather arcane use
of <tt>lambda</tt>:
<ul><tt>((lambda (key value)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; (setf (gethash key *table*) value))</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;(first pair)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;(second pair))</tt></ul>
but note that we could have done the same thing more legibly either by
inserting a <tt>funcall</tt>
<ol><tt>(funcall (lambda (key value)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (setf
(gethash key *table*) value))</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (first pair)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (second pair))</tt></ol>
or [much better] by transforming the expression to use
<tt>let*</tt>
<ul><tt>(let* ((key (first pair))</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (value (second pair)))</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; (setf (gethash key *table*) value))</tt></ul>
and so you rarely see <tt>lambda</tt> used like this.</ol>

<p><br><b>11.7 Practical session / Suggested activity</b>

and implement them for yourself.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
Seeing as we're stuck with <tt>let</tt> in the language, use it to implement
<tt>my-let*</tt>.</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
Pick one or more of the macros discussed so far and attempt to implement
them. Some are harder than others:</li>

<table BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=20 CELLPADDING=3 >
<tr>
<td>Easiest</td>

<td><tt>and&nbsp; prog1&nbsp; prog2</tt></td>
</tr>

<tr VALIGN=TOP>
<td>A little harder</td>

<td><tt>case&nbsp; decf&nbsp; dolist </tt>(in terms of <tt>loop</tt>)<tt>&nbsp;
dotimes </tt>(ditto)<tt>&nbsp; incf&nbsp; or&nbsp; pushnew&nbsp; rotatef&nbsp;
shiftf&nbsp; trace </tt>(use the simplified syntax introduced in section
5.2)<tt>&nbsp; untrace&nbsp; with-open-file</tt></td>
</tr>

<tr VALIGN=TOP>
<td>Why are these ones indvisable?</td>

<td><tt>defconstant&nbsp; defparameter defstruct&nbsp; defun&nbsp; ignore-errors&nbsp;
lambda&nbsp; loop&nbsp; setf&nbsp;</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>

<li>
(Very difficult. Prize for first correct answer.) Evaluate the following
forms in a lisp listener:</li>

<ul>
<li>
<tt>(lambda (x) nil)</tt></li>

<li>
<tt>(function-lambda-expression (lambda (x) nil))</tt></li>
</ul>
and then consider the following cute puzzle among lispers: to come up with
a self-reproducing <tt>consp</tt> form. A <i>self-reproducing</i> form
is defined for the purposes of this question as one that evaluates to something
<tt>equal</tt>
to the original form. In other words, you need to come up with a form <tt>x</tt>
such that
<ul><tt>(and (consp x)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (equal x (eval x)))</tt></ul>
is true.
<br>It is considered cheating if your solution involves any permanent side
effects. For example, we could trivially solve the problem by first defining
a function <tt>foo</tt>, say, that returns <tt>(foo)</tt> as its value.
But we disqualify this solution because defining a function counts as a
permanent side effect. As you might no doubt suspect, the best known solution
involves the use of <tt>lambda</tt>.
<br>The solution that I am aware of is two lines of code. I would be curious
to know if there are longer solutions (a family of them perhaps). Anybody
with time on their hands to prove their research abilities is welcome to
impress me.</ul>
<b>11.8 Further reading / exercises.</b>
<ul>
<li>
Graham chapter 10. Skip exercise 4 if you're not happy with the macro <tt>do</tt>
(I never voluntaily use it, so why should you have to?).</li>

<li>
Answer no more than one of the following questions:</li>

<ul>
<li>
Why should nobody voluntarily want to use <tt>do</tt>?</li>

<li>
What is it about the macro <tt>do</tt> which means you don't have to know
how any of the other iteration macros work? Is this true?</li>
</ul>

<li>
Write a macro <tt>my-if</tt> which translates calls of the form <tt>(my-if
a then b)</tt> or <tt>(my-if a then b else c)</tt> into standard <tt>if</tt>
forms. Go back through your work, find some function you've written using
<tt>if</tt>
and rewrite it to use <tt>my-if</tt> instead.</li>

<li>
Read the specification of print-unreadable-object above and then see if
you can determine (before trying it out) what the following would print:</li>

<ul><tt>(print-unreadable-object (*standard-output* *standard-output*))</tt></ul>
When you do try it out, why do you see a <tt>nil</tt>?
<li>
The definition of <tt>add-em</tt> in 11.5 above builds a list with <tt>mapcar</tt>
and then throws it away soon after. Rewrite <tt>add-em</tt> using <tt>lambda</tt>
to avoid this waste.</li>

<li>
Revisit your implementation of <tt>eval</tt> from week 9, and extend it
in the light of this lecture.</li>

<li>
Revisit the last exercise in section 9.10. This should now look more elegant.</li>
</ul>
