<p><b>6.2 Vectors</b>
<p>We have now met and played extensively with lisp's most flexible compound
data type: the list. (To be pedantic, we met the cons, and you can use
conses to build lists. Enough.) Lisp has plenty of other ways of grouping
data together...
<p>The function <tt>vector</tt> generates vectors (one-dimensional arrays)
in exactly the same way as <tt>list</tt> generates lists. It can take any
number of arguments and will generate a vector of that length:
<p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; (vector 'foo "bar" 99)&nbsp; =>&nbsp; #(foo "bar" 99)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; (list 'foo "bar" 99)&nbsp; =>&nbsp; (foo "bar" 99)</tt>
<p>Or, if you want to generate a vector and all you know at this stage
is its length, you can use <tt>make-array</tt> (and btw there is a list
equivalent called <tt>make-list</tt>, although in practice it's not very
useful - why? - and therefore is not used much).
<p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; (make-array 5)&nbsp; =>&nbsp; #(nil nil nil nil nil)&nbsp;&nbsp;
; stuffed with nil</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; (make-list 5)&nbsp;&nbsp; =>&nbsp; (nil nil nil nil
nil)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ; ditto</tt>
<p>Note how vectors print out: <tt>#( .... )</tt>. In fact (syntactic sugar)
you can use the <tt>#()</tt> syntax to input a vector in the first place:
<blockquote><tt>CL-USER 2 > #(foo "bar" 99)</tt>
<br><tt>#(FOO "bar" 99)</tt>
<p><tt>CL-USER 3 ></tt></blockquote>
Recall also (from the beginning of lecture 3) that <u>everything in lisp
other than a symbol or cons is self-evaluating</u>. In particular a vector
is self-evaluating, which is why it didn't need to be quoted in the example
above.
<p>Vectors are of type <tt>vector</tt>, and the predicate <tt>vectorp</tt>
is true of them.
<p>The functions <tt>length</tt> and <tt>reverse</tt> from last week can
be used on vectors as well as on lists:
<blockquote><tt>(length #(foo "bar" 99))&nbsp;&nbsp; =>&nbsp; 3</tt>
<br><tt>(length #())&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
=>&nbsp; 0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ; the empty vector</tt>
<br><tt>(reverse #(foo "bar" 99))&nbsp; =>&nbsp; #(99 "bar" foo)</tt></blockquote>
To get values out of and into a vector, we have the setfable accessor <tt>aref</tt>
<blockquote><tt>(setf wibble #(foo "bar" 99))&nbsp;&nbsp; =>&nbsp; #(foo
"bar" 99)</tt>
<br><tt>wibble&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
=>&nbsp; #(foo "bar" 99)</tt>
<br><tt>(aref wibble 0)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
=>&nbsp; foo</tt>
<br><tt>(aref wibble 1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
=> "bar"</tt>
<br><tt>(setf (aref wibble 2) 'wombat)&nbsp; =>&nbsp; wombat</tt>
<br><tt>wibble&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
=>&nbsp; #(foo "bar" wombat)</tt></blockquote>
We note the following:
<ul>
<li>
<tt>aref</tt> accesses the first element of a vector with argument <tt>0</tt>
(like <tt>nth</tt>), and so on</li>

<li>
<tt>aref</tt> takes the vector as its first argument and the index as its
second argument (regrettably unlike <tt>nth</tt>, which takes the index
as its first argument and the list as its second argument)</li>

<li>
if you give an index which is out of range, you get an error (also unlike
<tt>nth</tt>,
which cheerfully returns <tt>nil</tt> if you fall off the end of a list)</li>

<ul><tt>CL-USER 5 > (aref #(foo "bar" 99) 99)</tt>
<p><tt>Error: The subscript 99 exceeds the limit 2 for the first dimension
of the array #(FOO "bar" 99).</tt></ul>
</ul>
And the crucial point is this:
<ul>
<li>
<tt>aref</tt> takes the same time to access the 5000th member of a vector
as it does to access the first (also unlike <tt>nth</tt>, which will take
~5000 times longer)</li>
</ul>
This is the inherent difference between vectors and lists (as opposed to
a difference between the two functions <tt>nth</tt> and <tt>aref</tt>).
If you want the flexibility of being able to change the length of a sequence
of objects, inserting elements at either end or even somewhere in the middle,
use a list to store them. If you want constant time access down the whole
of a sequence no matter how long it is, use a vector.
<p>What you should be aware of, but is not "part of this course":
<ul>
<li>
A vector can be thought of as a one-dimensional array. Lisp supports multi-dimensional
arrays, if you need them.</li>

<li>
If you really really really think you need to adjust the length of a vector
after you created it (this is known as having your cake and eating it)
it is possible, but be aware that it won't be cheap at runtime. You can
also displace one array into another. We won't mess with either of these,
which means that our vectors are known as <i>simple vectors</i> (hence
the <tt>simple</tt> in <tt>simple-base-string</tt>).</li>

<li>
If you want efficiency, you can tell lisp in advance that all the members
of a vector are of a particular type. For some types, eg numbers, this
will enable lisp to pack them in tighter and can reduce access times (and
duration of garbage collections). If you want to, read up about an array's
<tt>element-type</tt>
and the function <tt>upgraded-array-element-type</tt>.</li>
</ul>
Examples:
<blockquote><tt>(defun sum-members-of-vector (vec)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; (let* ((total 0))</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (dotimes (i (length vec))</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (incf total (aref vec i)))</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; total))</tt>
<p><tt>(defun vector-to-list (vec)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; (let* ((new-list nil))</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (dotimes (i (length vec))</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (push (aref vec i) new-list))</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (reverse new-list)))</tt>
<p><tt>(defun list-to-vector-a (list)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; (let* ((length (length list))</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (vec (make-array
length)))</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (dotimes (i length)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (setf (aref vec i) (pop list)))</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; vec))</tt>
<p><tt>(defun list-to-vector-b (list)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; (let* ((length (length list))</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (vec (make-array
length))</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (i 0))</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (dolist (thing list)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (setf (aref vec i) thing)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (incf i))</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; vec))</tt></blockquote>
<b>6.3 Strings and characters</b>
<p>We've also met and played with strings. Here is a string: <tt>"Lisp
is so wonderful"</tt>. We have also met a couple of ways of generating
strings: typing them in between quotation marks, and using <tt>(format
nil ...)</tt>. Another is to use the function <tt>make-string</tt>:
<blockquote><tt>(make-string 5)&nbsp; =>&nbsp; <i>some string of length
5 filled with random garbage</i></tt></blockquote>
If you need to get a quotation mark into a string, <i>escape</i> it with
a backslash, thus <tt>"\""</tt> is a string containing one character: a
quotation mark. To get a backslash into a string, escape it similarly:
<tt>"\\"</tt>.
<p>Any string is also a vector (we might say that <i><tt>string</tt> is
a subtype of <tt>vector</tt></i> - see the figure in 6.1 above), so any
operation you can perform on a vector can also be performed on a string.
For instance, you can ask for its <tt>length</tt>, you can <tt>reverse</tt>
it (as ever, this gives you a fresh string and reverses that, the original
string remaining unchanged), you can <tt>aref</tt> into it to get your
hands on individual characters and <tt>(setf aref)</tt> to modify them.
<blockquote><tt>(setf my-string "Lisp is great")&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
=>&nbsp; "Lisp is great"</tt>
<br><tt>(length my-string)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
=>&nbsp; 13</tt>
<br><tt>(reverse my-string)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
=>&nbsp; "taerg si psiL"</tt>
<br><tt>my-string&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
=>&nbsp; "Lisp is great"</tt>
<br><tt>(aref my-string 0)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
=>&nbsp; #\L</tt>
<br><tt>(aref my-string (1- (length my-string)))&nbsp; =>&nbsp; #\t</tt>
<br><tt>(setf (aref my-string 6) #\t)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
=>&nbsp; #\t</tt>
<br><tt>my-string&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
=>&nbsp; "Lisp it great"</tt></blockquote>
Strings are of type <tt>string</tt> (and so the predicate <tt>stringp</tt>
is true of them). The predicate <tt>vectorp</tt> also is true of them,
because all strings are vectors too.
<blockquote><tt>(typep my-string 'string)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
=>&nbsp; t</tt>
<br><tt>(typep my-string 'vector)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
=>&nbsp; t</tt>
<br><tt>(typep #() 'string)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
=>&nbsp; nil</tt></blockquote>
Equivalently:
<blockquote><tt>(stringp my-string)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
=>&nbsp; t</tt>
<br><tt>(vectorp my-string&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
=>&nbsp; t</tt>
<br><tt>(stringp #())&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
=>&nbsp; nil</tt></blockquote>
Each member of a string has to be a character (try <tt>(setf (aref my-string
6) nil)</tt> and see what happens to you). This sets strings aside from
lists and from more general vectors, where you can mix'n'match the types
of elements and lisp doesn't care. Characters are read in and printed out
like this:
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; #\w&nbsp;&nbsp; ; the character standing for
lower-case "w"</tt>
<br>The following specially named characters might be useful to you one
day:
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; #\Space&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; #\Newline&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
#\Tab</tt>
<br>I personally tend to capitalize these special names although lisp,
being not very case-sensitive, doesn't notice it.
<p>If you want to compare a whole load of characters to see if they're
the same, use <tt>char=</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (char= #\a #\a #\a)&nbsp; =>&nbsp; t</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (char= #\A #\a #\a)&nbsp; =>&nbsp; nil</tt>
<br>And there is a case-insensitive version of <tt>char=</tt> called <tt>char-equal</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (char-equal #\A #\a #\A)&nbsp; =>&nbsp; t</tt>
<p>If you are desperate to convert between characters and their ASCII values,
the functions <tt>char-code</tt> and <tt>code-char</tt> will assist:
<blockquote><tt>(char-code #\p)&nbsp; =>&nbsp; 112</tt>
<br><tt>(code-char 112)&nbsp; =>&nbsp; #\p</tt></blockquote>
The predicate <tt>characterp</tt> is true of all characters, the predicates
<tt>alpha-char-p</tt>
and <tt>digit-char-p</tt> are true of letters of the alphabet and digits
respectively, and <tt>alphanumericp</tt> is true of letters or digits:
<blockquote><tt>(let ((characters '(#\x #\8 #\*)))</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; (list (mapcar 'alpha-char-p characters)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (mapcar 'digit-char-p
characters)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (mapcar 'alphanumericp
characters)))</tt>
<br><tt>=></tt>
<br><tt>((t nil nil) (nil 8 nil) (t t nil))&nbsp; ; the 8, while inelegant,
is non-nil</tt></blockquote>
If you look in the books / HyperSpec you'll find all sorts of goodies in
the reference sections on strings and characters. Some random examples:
<blockquote><tt>(string-capitalize "ethel the aardvark")&nbsp; =>&nbsp;
"Ethel The Aardvark"</tt>
<br><tt>(string-downcase "Ethel The Aardvark")&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; =>&nbsp;
"ethel the aardvark"</tt>
<br><tt>(string&lt; "Earlier" "Later")&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
=>&nbsp; t&nbsp; ; alphabetical ordering</tt>
<br><tt>(char-name #\x)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
=>&nbsp; "Latin-Small-Letter-X"</tt></blockquote>
Finally, for the sake of completeness (only), let me mention two further
ways to generate strings. Given that I said that all strings are vectors
and that you can create vectors with <tt>make-array</tt>...
<blockquote><tt>(make-array 5 :element-type 'standard-char)</tt></blockquote>
... is equivalent to <tt>(make-string 5)</tt>. Don't remember the details
of the above, but do note that it can be done.
<p>The other way is the function <tt>read-line</tt> which can be used for
reading strings from the listener. When <tt>read-line</tt> is called, the
system waits for keyboard input. Everything typed up to (but not including)
the next
<tt>#\Newline</tt> is returned in a fresh string. For example,
<blockquote><tt>CL-USER 10 > (read-line)</tt>
<br><tt>This is what I typed to generate a string which read-line returned.</tt>
<br><tt>"This is what I typed to generate a string which read-line returned."</tt>
<br><tt>NIL</tt>
<p><tt>CL-USER 11 ></tt></blockquote>
[If you're observant, you'll want to know what the <tt>nil</tt> is doing
here. Well, <tt>read-line</tt> returns <u>two</u> values, the string we
read in and a flag to tell you whether the string was terminated by end-of-file
(as opposed to terminated by a <tt>#\Newline</tt>). Although you cannot
on Windows<sup>(tm) </sup>generate end-of-file in any window you can type
at, <tt>read-line</tt> can be asked to take its input from a file (or socket
etc) and then the flag becomes relevant. Functions which return multiple
values are a little beyond the scope of this course, but do be aware that
they provide a saner alterntive to all that mucking around with "inout"
parameters that other languages depend on.]
<p><b>6.4 Quick digression - keywords</b>
<p>Anyone who's still awake will have noticed the (a) the colon before
the symbol <tt>element-type</tt> above and (b) that I didn't quote the
symbol.
<p>A symbol preceded by a colon is called a <i>keyword</i>. Keywords are
symbols (so they respond warmly to <tt>symbolp</tt>) but they are distinguished
by <u>always being self-evaluating</u>.
<blockquote><tt>:brand-new-keyword&nbsp; =>&nbsp; :brand-new-keyword</tt></blockquote>
It's as if whenever you type in a new keyword <tt>:foo</tt>, the system
goes
<tt>(defconstant :foo ':foo)</tt> behind your back.
<p>(OK, so we didn't cover <tt>defconstant</tt> before. It's like <tt>defparameter</tt>
except that you guarantee not to go changing that symbol's value later
on. So <tt>(defconstant foo 99) </tt>followed by<tt> (setf foo 88)</tt>
signals an error.)
<p>Keywords are mainly used in complex argument lists with lots of optional
arguments. We'll come back to this later, but here's an example: the function
<tt>string=</tt>.
This takes two strings (let's call them <tt>string1</tt> and <tt>string2</tt>)
and returns true if they match, character for character. It's case-sensitive
(use <tt>string-equal</tt> if you want case-insensitive). You can optionally
specify that you only want to compare part of either string (or both),
by means of the keyword arguments <tt>:start1 :start2 :end1 :end2</tt>
(which are zero-based, and which default to the start and end of the respective
strings if you don't specify them). <tt>string=</tt> returns true if the
supplied substrings are of the same length and contain the same characters
in corresponding positions; otherwise it returns <tt>nil</tt>.
<blockquote><tt>(string= "I love lisp" "lisp is wonderful" :start1 7 :end2
4)&nbsp; =>&nbsp; t</tt></blockquote>
You can specify the keywords in any combination and in any order.
<p>[There is a convention that a <tt>:start</tt> argument points to the
first character in the substring, and an <tt>:end</tt> argument points
to the character following the end of the substring. Brownie points / smarties
for telling me why.]
<p><b>6.5 Practical session</b>
<p>Write a program to ask the user to type in a sentence, read it using
<tt>read-line</tt>
and then count how many words there were in this sentence.
<p><b>6.6 Suggested activity / exercises etc</b>
<ol>
<li>
Go through Chapter 4 of Graham (omit sections 6,7 and 8) and then exercises
1 and 2 at the end of it.</li>

<li>
Suppose you have been given a string and you want to find out how often
each (alphabetical, i.e. ignore spaces, puncuation and the like) character
occurs in it. Implement a function to solve this problem for you. [Some
of you will have seen a similar problem before.] Hints:</li>

<ul>
<li>
<tt>string-downcase</tt></li>

<li>
<tt>char-code</tt></li>

<li>
<tt>make-array</tt> - this takes a keyword argument <tt>:initial-element
</tt>which
you can use to fill the array with some starting value other than <tt>nil</tt>
and&nbsp; you may find this feature useful here. For example try out both
of the following:</li>

<ul><tt>(make-array 5)</tt>
<br><tt>(make-array 5 :initial-element 'foo)</tt></ul>

<li>
<tt>dotimes</tt></li>

<li>
<tt>incf</tt></li>
</ul>

<li>
Keen observers of section 6.3 will have asked by now why we can't use <tt>equal</tt>
rather than <tt>char=</tt>. The answer is that char= can compare more than
two values in one function call, which might sometimes (though not often,
I'll grant you) be useful; on the other hand <tt>equal</tt> takes precisely
two arguments. Write a version of <tt>equal</tt> which takes any number
of arguments. Since you don't yet know how to define a function which takes
a completely variable number of arguments, pass them all in a single list.
For example:</li>

<ol><tt>(better-equal '("aardvark" "aardvark" "aardvark" "aardvark"))&nbsp;
=>&nbsp; t</tt>
<br><tt>(better-equal '("aardvark" "aardvark" "aardvark" "goat"))&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
=>&nbsp; nil</tt></ol>

<li>
Implement a function which takes two arguments, a list and a vector, and
determines whether they have the same elements (in the same order). If
you did this iteratively, now do it again recursively. Or vice versa.</li>

<li>
Look up how the function <tt>subseq</tt> works. It is not part of the lecture
course, but has been useful to students attempting the assignments.</li>
</ol>
<b>6.7 Major assignment</b><b></b>
<p>Pick one or both of the <a href="../index-2.html#additionals">assignments</a>
and work on it in parallel with the rest of this course.
