<p>In May 2009 O'Reilly agreed to publish a book about Common Lisp,
and I agreed to write it.</p>

<p>My aim was to show people who suspected that Lisp was dead because
it couldn't look outside the box, along with those who hoped it could
but didn't know how, that the going wasn't all that hard. Although the
book would introduce Common Lisp from scratch and give generous
treatment to those features which make the language great, it wasn't
going to cover the whole thing or anything like it. I wanted to make
Lisp look easy and steer the novice away from the more complex edge
cases.</p>

<p>The core of the book would be a number of in-depth examples which
between them thoroughly addressed the use of libraries whether or not
these were written in Lisp. I planned to visit common, important
utilities for dealing with persistence, threading, GUIs, system
building and more. Examples would include: an end-user desktop
application, a web server, and an introduction to getting Lisp working
on a mobile phone.</p>

<p>Nine months into the project my rubbish state of health forced me
to abandon being an O'Reilly author and all work on the book ceased. I
had written eleven chapters (with another 20 to go).</p>

<p>Everything I wrote is now available under a Creative Commons
license, in the hope that it might be useful to somebody. Please
regard this as constituting an ex-work in progress which I deserted
overnight 15 months ago: the writing, correcting and editing were
uneven when I left off and, I regret, that's how they're going to
stay. I was happier with some chapters
(<a href="contents/chgo.pdf">1</a>, <a href="contents/chgc.pdf">16</a>,
 <a href="contents/chopt.pdf">20</a> and in
particular <a href="contents/chhttp.pdf"> 21</a>) and less so with
others. And then there's a list of lesser known
problems, <a href="http://lisp-book.org/issue">here</a>.</p>

<p>The occasional book-related blog entries I penned while I was an
author are <a href="http://lisp-book.org/blog">here</a>.</p>

<p>Finally: I gave a talk about my experiences writing the book, along
with some thoughts about lisp libraries in general, at
the <a href="http://weitz.de/eclm2011/">2011 European Common Lisp
Meeting</a>. My slides are here
(<a href="talks/eclm-2011-10-23/slides.txt">text</a> /
<a href="talks/eclm-2011-10-23/html/00-title.html">html</a>) alongside
some <a href="talks/eclm-2011-10-23/plan.txt">longer notes</a> from
which they were produced.</p>
