<h1>Lisp Outside the Box / Contents</h1>

<p>This was my draft outline. Eleven of the chapters are now
available as drafts in PDF form - just follow the links below.</p>

<p>Early chapters introduced Common Lisp and were implementation
neutral. The rest of the book revolved around specific proprietary and
non-proprietary libraries; each part focused more or less on a
different lisp implementation: Allegro, Clozure, SBCL, LispWorks,
Clojure.</p>

<p>I started writing in the middle (because the needs of later
chapters were going to drive the contents of earlier ones). After a
while I went back to the beginning and continued work from there.</p>

<p>Something you hoped to see not on the list? I can but <a
href="http://enlivend.livejournal.com/12902.html">apologise</a>.</p>

<p>Found a mistake? Check whether someone else <a href="../../issue.html">beat
you to it</a>, then let me know.</p>

<h4>PART THREE "Libraries Inside the Box"</h4>

<p>
Most lisp implementations are accompanied by a rich set of
supplementary libraries. Although the aim of this book is to look
"outside the box", it's worth noting that the box is typically larger
than you'd think; so let's use a few of the libraries which accompany
one of the lisp distributions as our starting point.
</p>

<p>
We'll start our tour of lisp libraries with a look at a persistent
memory system called
<em>AllegroCache</em>. This library is proprietary
and it ships with Allegro Common Lisp (<em>ACL</em>).
</p>

<p>
We'll wander through the AllegroCache documentation looking out for
salient features. These will lead us to a couple of ubiquitous
extensions to Common Lisp (memory management, and multithreading) and
we'll digress to examime them in some detail.
</p>

<p>
The <em>Express Edition</em> of ACL is free for personal use and will
be suitable for running the examples in the next two chapters. It has
a number of built-in restrictions; the one that's most likely to bite
is its limit of three AllegroCache <em>connections</em> and I'll
remind you of that later. Chapters 15 and 16 are more general and with
little modification the examples can be run on most implementations.
</p>


<ol start="13">
  <li><a href="chac.pdf">Persistence with AllegroCache</a></li>
  <li><a href="chac2.pdf">Further AllegroCache</a></li>
  <li><a href="chmp.pdf">Concurrency</a></li>
  <li><a href="chgc.pdf">Memory</a></li>
</ol>

<a id="four" name="four"></a>
<h4>PART FOUR "Libraries Outside the Box"</h4>

<p>
It's times to take a first look outside. We'll download and install
the <em>ch-image</em> image processing library and put it through its
paces on Clozure Common Lisp. Along the way we'll pause to consider
two invaluable tools: the <em>SLIME</em> development environment and
<em>ASDF</em> for system definition. Image processing can get hungry
for machine cycles, so this will also be a good opportunity for
discussing optimizations.
</p>

<p>
All the libraries we'll be looking at here, along with Clozure CL
itself, are open-source and free to use.
</p>

<ol start="17">
  <li><a href="chimg.pdf">Image Processing</a></li>
  <li><a href="chslime.pdf">SLIME</a></li>
  <li><a href="chasdf.pdf">Systems</a></li>
  <li><a href="chopt.pdf">Performance</a></li>
</ol>

<a id="five" name="five"></a>
<h4>PART FIVE "Server Boxes"</h4>

<p>
We're ready to graduate to writing servers. We'll be working with
several libraries over the next four chapters and in particular the
Hunchentoot web server. We'll consider socket communications in
general, different approaches to HTTP, techniques for parsing input
and generating output, and how to make your server "solid".
</p>

<p>
Although we'll be working on Steel Bank Common Lisp (SBCL) you might
have some trouble spotting that. All the examples will be shown within
the SLIME REPL (<xref linkend="chslime" />) and we'll be using
portable interface layers for sockets and threading which hide
implementation-specifics from the programmer. We'll run on Ubuntu
Linux; again that won't be apparent from the code which will be OS
independent.
</p>

<p>
All the libraries we'll be looking at here, along with SBCL itself,
are open-source and free to use.
</p>

<ol start="21">
  <li><a href="chhttp.pdf">Serving HTTP</a></li>
  <li>Parsing Input</li>
  <li>Generating HTML</li>
  <li>Hunchentoot</li>
</ol>

<a id="six" name="six"></a>
<h4>PART SIX "Gift-wrapping the Box"</h4>

<ol start="25">
  <li>A desktop application</li>
  <li>GUI development environments</li>
  <li>Internationalization</li>
  <li>World building</li>
</ol>

<a id="seven" name="seven"></a>
<h4>PART SEVEN "Talking to Other Boxes"</h4>

<ol start="29">
  <li>Talking to C</li>
  <li>RabbitMQ</li>
  <li>Clojure</li>
</ol>

<h4>APPENDICES</h4>
