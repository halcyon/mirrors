<h2><a id="section-1" name="section-1">1. Introduction</a></h2>

<div align="center"><h3>Can you solve the "Last Piece Puzzle"? Can you solve it in lisp?</h3></div>

<p>The <a
href="http://www.blueopal.com.au/products/catalog/brain/html/lastpiece.html">"Last
Piece Puzzle"</a> consists of <a href="#section-3.1">fourteen
pieces</a> which have to be fitted into a <a
href="#section-3.2">frame</a>. There are pictures on each piece but
these give no help with the solution (each picture is fully contained
within a single piece, and the pictures are rotated so that their
orientation can't be used as a clue). The pieces interlock with each
other and with the frame; if we ignore the slots and tabs then the
frame is an 8x8 square and the pieces are <a
href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Polyomino.html">polyominos</a>:
nine pentominos, four tetrominos, one triomino. For the most part,
slots and tabs alternate around both the frame and all the pieces, and
all the slots and tabs are the same size and shape. There are two
exceptions to this alternation of slots and tabs, and we'll come to
these in a moment. If there were no exceptions then we would be able
to fit the pieces in like this:</p>

<div align="center"><img src="gifs/nosolve.gif" width="400"
height="400"
alt="example configuration of pieces, not actually possible because of the 'exceptions'"
title="example configuration of pieces, not actually possible because of the 'exceptions'" /></div>

<p>The two exceptions to the slot / tab alternation are coloured in
the above diagram. They are:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>the frame has a slot where you'd expect a tab (this leaves a
     gap between the frame and one of the pieces in this example,
     coloured green here);</p></li>
<li><p>the triomino has a tab where you'd expect a slot (this makes
     two pieces overlap a little in the example, coloured red).</p></li>
</ul>

<p>As a result of the exceptions it turns out that we are constrained
to place the triomino so that its unexpected tab fits into the frame's
unexpected slot, thus:</p>

<div align="center"><img src="gifs/starter.gif" width="400"
height="400"
alt="place the triomino in only posible position"
title="place the triomino in only posible position" /></div>

<p>Can you place the remaining thirteen pieces? Can you do it in
lisp?</p>



<h2><a id="section-2" name="section-2">2. Contest</a></h2>


<p>The aim in this contest is for you to write a program, in <a
href="http://www.lispworks.com/reference/HyperSpec/Front/index.htm">Common
Lisp</a>, to solve the above puzzle, giving positions and orientations
for each piece. </p>

<p>By entering the contest, you are deemed to have accepted all of
the following, so please read them carefully.</p>


<ol>


<li>
    <p>The deadline for submissions will be noon EDT on Saturday
    2003-09-27 (universal time 3273667200).</p>
</li>


<li>
    <p>Entries may be submitted only by email, which should be sent to
    ILC03-lisp-contest (at) alu (dot) org. The string
    "ILC03-lisp-contest" should appear in the subject line. If such
    email would be over 1 megabyte in length, please send instead a
    short message to this address stating how your entry can be
    acquired by some other electronic means (http / ftp, etc).</p>
</li>


<li>
    <p>Prizes may be awarded in the following categories:</p>

    <ul>

      <li><p>first working answer to be submitted;</p></li>

      <li><p>fastest running program -- this is a test of algorithm, not
      of use of optimizations, therefore (a) no <a
      href="http://www.lispworks.com/reference/HyperSpec/Body/d_type.htm">type
      declarations</a> or <a
      href="http://www.lispworks.com/reference/HyperSpec/Body/s_the.htm">the
      forms</a> will be permitted and (b) the judges reserve the right
      to run entries on the lisp implementation(s) of their choice;</p></li>

      <li><p>most elegant algorithm;</p></li>

      <li><p>most elegant use of lisp;</p></li>

      <li><p>best use of really obscure lisp features;</p></li>

      <li><p>contestants under the age of 21 on the first day of the <a
      href="http://www.international-lisp-conference.org/">conference</a>;</p></li>

      <li><p>best "added value".</p></li>

    </ul>

    <p>The judges reserve the rights (a) not to award a prize in any
    category if they do not believe the standard of entries in that
    category merits it, (b) to create additional prize categories
    after the closing date for submissions and (c) to entertain
    any suggestions, which are received before the deadline for
    submissions, for other categories. </p>

</li>


<li>
    <p>Names of prize winners will be announced at the conference, and
    subsequently on this website.</p>
</li>


<li>
    <p>The prizes will be tasteful medals of low scrap-metal value. As
    if fame wasn't enough.</p>
</li>


<li>
    <p>Entries are to consist of source code, plus sufficient
    documentation (potentially in the form of comments) to allow the
    judges to (a) build and run the program and (b) understand the
    algorithm employed to solve the puzzle.</p>
</li>


<li>
    <p>Please include with each entry a list of any sources
    (e.g. publications, internet sites, etc) used to generate that
    entry.</p>
</li>


<li>
    <p>Team entries will be allowed. Please indicate with your entry
    if this is a team effort, and name the particpants.</p>
</li>


<li>
    <p>All entries will be tested on the same machine: a laptop
    running Windows XP. If you intend to submit an entry which cannot
    be run on this machine then you are advised to consult with the
    judges beforehand. You may be responsible for bringing hardware to
    the conference on which to demonstrate your entry, and - depending
    on the speed of that hardware - your entry may not be eligible to
    win a prize under the "fastest running program" category.</p>
</li>


<li>
    <p>If you intend to submit an entry which is not written <a
    href="http://www.lispworks.com/reference/HyperSpec/Body/26_glo_p.htm#portable">portably</a>
    then you are advised to consult with the judges beforehand. The
    judges will make reasonable efforts to obtain particular lisp
    implementations on which to test entries, provided there is
    sufficient justification for doing so. Use of an
    implementation-specific UI will be considered to be a "sufficient
    justification".</p>
</li>


<li>
    <p>Employees of Blue Opal Australia Pty Ltd and of Ravenbrook
    Limited, the judges, and the immediate families of all of these,
    are not eligible to enter this contest.</p>
</li>


<li>
    <p>The judges will be Nick Levine and Nicholas Barnes. The judges
    can be contacted by email via ILC03-lisp-contest (at) alu (dot)
    org. Include the string "ILC03-lisp-contest" in the subject
    line. The judges' decision will be final in all matters, including
    whether or not to enter into any correspondance.</p>
</li>


<li>
    <p>Although each entry will remain the intellectual property of
    the entrant, the judges may demonstrate and publish winning
    entries at the conference, and may publish them in conference
    proceedings and on this website. Entries must be licensed in such
    a manner as to permit these activities freely..</p>
</li>


</ol>



<h2><a id="section-3" name="section-3">3. Pieces and frame</a></h2>

<p>Sketches of the fourteen pieces and the frame into which they must
be fitted are reproduced below. Please note that these are only
approximate representations. All pieces are made up of between three
and five squares "stuck together"; all these squares are the same
size; all tabs and slots are the same size and in the centre of an
edge of one of the squares which comprise that piece. Once the
triomino has been placed you can think of the frame as a chessboard
(i.e. alternate black and white squares); of each piece as a small
collection of  alternate black and white squares; and of your task as
being to place the 13 remaining pieces such that black squares on the
pieces are always and only placed onto black squares on the board.</p>


<h3><a id="section-3.1" name="section-3.1">3.1. The pieces</a></h3>

<p>For the purposes of identification, we have given each piece a name
which you may or may not care to use. These names are all single
characters: upper case alphabetic for the pentominos, lower case for
the tetrominos, digit for the triomino.</p>

<h2><a id="section-4" name="section-4">4. Material added to this page since it was first posted</a></h2>

<p>Last updated: $Date: 2014/04/27 $.</p>

<ul>

<li><p>The <a href="#section-2">rules</a> omit to mention that
entrants in the "under 21" category will have to tell the judges that
they're under 21, otherwise we won't know.</p></li>

<li><p>We've been asked whether the pieces can be turned over. The
answer is no: the pieces can be rotated only about an axis vertical to
the paper / your screen.</p></li>

<li><p>We've been asked whether a solution actually exists. The back
of the puzzle, which counts as being in the "public domain", says:
<cite>We guarantee it can be done...</cite></p></li>

<li><p>We've been asked whether it's allowed to submit more than one
entry. The answer is that you may submit more than one entry, but only
your last submission (before the closing date) will be
judged.</p></li>

<li><p>We've been asked whether any entries have been received to
date. The answer is that entries (plusp length) have been received but
they have not been examined by the judges, therefore we cannot yet say
whether anybody has yet qualified for any of the prizes.</p></li>

<li><p>We've been asked to clarify the meaning of "fastest running
program". This is to be defined as the total time, as measured by <a
href="http://www.lispworks.com/reference/HyperSpec/Body/m_time.htm">time</a>,
taken to read source, expand macros, compile code, load compiled code,
and execute it. Plus anything else we forgot to mention here. The
judges will take steps to integrate each entry into the implementation
used for the timings, in such a way as to ensure a level playing field
for each entry.</p></li>

<li><p>There was an error in the figure, near the head of section 1,
which illustrates an example configuration of the pieces. This
configuration is not actually possible because of the two 'exceptions'
to the slot / tab alternation rule. The original version of this
figure (corrected on 2003-08-14) showed one piece (the triomino) in
the wrong place, and as a result replaced the "Q" pentomino with
another piece which is not part of the puzzle. This error, while
confusing, does not materially affect the contest because the
illustration was explicitly labelled as an invalid arrangment of
pieces. (Nevertheless we apologise for any anxiety caused by
it.) To correct the error, we made the following change, where "?" is
used to denote the interloping piece:</p>

<blockquote><pre>
    JJJJLLLL     JJJJLLLL
    NNsJL???     NNsJL3QQ
    TNss??3j     TNss33Qj
    TNNst33j -&gt;  TNNstQQj
    TTWtttjj     TTWtttjj
    TWWZZZll     TWWZZZll
    WWSSFZZl     WWSSFZZl
    SSSFFFFl     SSSFFFFl
</pre></blockquote></li>

</ul>
