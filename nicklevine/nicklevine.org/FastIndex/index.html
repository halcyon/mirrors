    <p>This site used to house a small <i>online library</i>. It
      contained all Sherlock Holmes stories readily avaliable from online
      sources, plus a few miscellaneous works which I added for testing
      purposes and then saw no good reason to remove.
   </p>
   <p>
      The central feature of the site was its <i>search engine</i>,
      written specifically for this application. All users had a
      personal <i>bookshelf</i> on which they could place volumes in
      which they were interested. Passages located through the search
      engine could be <i>bookmarked</i> and these too could be
      accessed via the bookshelf. You had the option to
      <i>register</i>. Registration was simple and free; it probably
      took less than two minutes of your time; its main purpose was to
      allow the system to recognize you next time you visited and to
      give you access to your previous bookshelf; no password was
      required.
   </p>
   <p>
      The code for this server was written in early 2000 and it ran
      faithfully for over seven years before I finally pulled the plug
      -- it was getting less than one hit per month and that wasn't
      worth the bother of keeping it running. If you have a reason for
      seeing it running please <a href="mailto:ndl@ravenbrook.com">get
      in touch</a>.
