# 1.  INTRODUCTION

"""
This module lists configurations for the Mumble library and pyMumble package.
"""


# 2.  CONFIGURATIONS FOR CONNECT.PY
#
# libraryPath is a list of paths (absolute or relative) which will be
# searched for the Mumble library ('mumble.dll' on Windows).

libraryPath = ['']


# 3.  CONFIGURATIONS FOR ERROR.PY
#
# show_backtrace determines whether errors within the Mumble library
# will include a verbose backtrace or just a one-line description of
# the error. Note for Python users: this backtrace dosn't oringate
# from Python; the most recent call comes first. The most interesting
# frame is probably the call immediately following the "Call to ERROR".
#
# If you're getting a Mumble error you don't understand, please enable
# backtraces and forward one without delay to mumble@ravenbrook.com.
# We'll help you interpret it if the problem was at your end, or get a
# fix to you if the fault was inside Mumble.

show_backtrace = False
