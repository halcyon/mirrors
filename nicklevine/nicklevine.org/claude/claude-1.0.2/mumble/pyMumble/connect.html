# 1.  INTRODUCTION

"""
This module handles connection to, and disconnection from, the Mumble DLL.

The library exports two functions, mumble_init() and mumble_close(), for
performing these actions. Examples of their use provided here.

The library's calling convention is stdcall.

Importing this module sets the global variable dll to the ctypes
shared library object. This value can then used elsewhere to invoke
Mumble functionality.
