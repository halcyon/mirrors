# 1.  INTRODUCTION

"""

This module extracts results from, and performs basic error checks on, calls into the Mumble library.

The module checks whether addresses to be passed into the Mumble
library are potentially valid, and whether calls into the library have
signalled errors. It creates pointers so that the library can return
results by reference; these pointers are prepended to function
argument lists, the library is invoked and the results are extracted.

The function check examines the return value of a function call into
the library. If this value is not SUCCESS (0) then a MumbleError is
raised.

The MumbleError exception calls mumble_last_error() and reports the
result. As corner cases, it checks whether (a) there was any error in
the first place, (b) it was possible to report the error and (c) it
was possible to mumble_free() the error report. In the last case a
warning note is tacked onto the head of the report.

The backtraces reported by mumble_last_error() may be longer and less
edifying than you care for. Control whether you want to see them at
all by setting the configuration variable show_backtrace in config.py.

See last_error in lib.py for a full description of mumble_last_error().

    description of structure layout.
