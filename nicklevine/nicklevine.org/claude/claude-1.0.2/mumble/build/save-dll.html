;;;			    SAVE-DLL.LISP
;;;	       Nick Levine, Ravenbrook Ltd, 2013-03-08

;; This script should be loaded into a TTY LispWorks (using the -init
;; command-line option is recommended) to save your CLAUDE-based
;; library as a DLL.
;;
;; Your system should have been defined in the file ../src/defsys.lisp
;; (relative to this one). If you'd rather use ASDF to manage your
;; code then the definition will be in the .asd file one level up from
;; this file; you'll need an obvious edit to (defun application-load)
;; to support this.
;;
;; Supply "-force" on the command-line to force recompile the system.
;;
;; Supply "-devel" to save a full development image (LispWorks IDE
;; opens when your library is initialized); otherwise the library
;; will be delivered at level 0.
;;
;;
;; Libraries
;;
;; We don't _need_ Quicklisp, but we do need two Quicklisp libraries
;; (Bordeaux Threads, and the Common Foreign Function Interface) and
;; it's assumed that Quicklisp knows where to find them. What's
;; essential is that CLAUDE can say that it :depends-on these two
;; systems, and that ASDF can then find them.
;;
;;
;; Configurations:
;;
;; 1. If you have a .ico file which you want associated with the
;; library, uncomment the :icon-file line in the call to deliver.
;;
;; 2. In the IDE you might find it handy for listeners to open in some
;; particular package. See #+try-this below.
