<h1>CL-LOG - a general purpose logging utility</h1>

<p>CL-LOG is a general purpose logging utility, loosely modelled in
some respects after Gary King's <a
href="http://common-lisp.net/project/log5/">Log5</a>.</p>

<p>Its features include:</p>

<ul>
<li>logging to several destinations at once, via "messengers",</li>
<li>each messenger is tailored to accept some log messages and
      reject others, and this tailoring can be changed on-the-fly,</li>
<li>very rapid processing of messages which are rejected by all
      messengers,</li>
<li>fully independent use of the utility by several different
  sub-systems in an application,</li>
<li>support for messengers which cl:format text to a stream,</li>
<li>support for messengers which do not invoke cl:format,</li>
<li>timestamps in theory accurate to internal-time-units-per-second.</li>
</ul>


<p>Typically, logging utilities only support the one, simple paradigm of
formatting objects to a text-stream. Removing this restriction allows
you to:</p>


<ul>
<li>log random objects instead of plain text,</li>
<li>generate internationalized log messages,</li>
<li>create specialised binary logs,</li>
<li>base the test-suite of complex applications around logging.</li>
</ul>

<p>Logging is controlled by the following classes: log-manager,
base-messenger, base-message, category-set; any of these might be
specialised by your application. Whether or not a messenger will
accept a given message is controlled by the "category" of the message
and the "filter" of the messenger; these are logical combinations of
atoms (typically keywords).</p>

<p>I'd expect CL-LOG to work as-is on
any <a href="http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/26_glo_c.htm#conforming_implementation">conforming
implementation</a> of Common Lisp. I've tested it on: ABCL, ACL, CCL,
LW, SBCL.</p>

<p>CL-LOG is released with an MIT-style license.</p>

<h2>Obtaining CL-LOG</h2>

<p>CL-LOG consists of two source files: <a
href="master/pkg.html">pkg.lisp</a> and <a
href="master/cl-log.html">cl-log.lisp</a>. An <a
href="http://www.cliki.net/asdf">asdf</a> <a
href="master/cl-log-2.html">definition</a> is also provided,
and a simple <a href="master/cl-log-test.html">test suite</a>.</p>

<p>There's also <a href="master/doc/index.txt">documentation</a> which is
longer than the source, so it's up to you which you read.</p>

<p>You can download the current release of all these files in
a <a href="cl-log-latest.tar.gz">bundle</a> (gzipped tarball).</p>

<p>Finally, CL-LOG and its test-suite are avaliable for download and
installation
via <a href="http://www.quicklisp.org/">Quicklisp</a>.</p>

<blockquote><pre>(ql:quickload :cl-log)
(ql:quickload :cl-log-test)</pre></blockquote>
