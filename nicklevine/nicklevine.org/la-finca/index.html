<h1>Directions for La Finca San Antonio</h1>

<p>See also <a href="map.jpg">this</a>.</p>

<p>From Marbella, starting from the "La Cañada" exit on the A7, head
north along the <strong>A355</strong> (direction Coín). </p>

<p>You stay on this road for <strong>10.5 km</strong>, passing two
exits for Ojén, both labelled A-7103.</p>

<p>After the second of these you're 1km from a <strong>left
turn</strong> to the hotel at <strong>Refugio De Juanar</strong>.
(Half way there is a left turn to a quarry, with a blue sign "500m" to
Refugio -- not here!) Keep going, the turning you want has a brown
sign, an island in the middle of the road for waiting in, and the road
starts by climbing fairly steeply immediately, and bending to the
right, with a big sign for the hotel.</p>

<p>As you come up the road to Refugio, you pass first the <strong>1km
sign</strong>, then after about 100m a clear <strong>bend to the
right</strong> (parking space under trees to left), then after another
~200m a <strong>"40" speed sign</strong>, and finally after about 10m
there are <strong>five white stones</strong> by the side of the road,
and a <strong>tree that's painted white</strong> at the base, on your
right. Between the stones and the tree is a track which heads down
into the valley.</p>

<p>If on the other hand you're coming from Refugio, you might find
that the turnoff is rather sharp, and that it's easiest to overshoot
the white stones &amp; tree on your <strong>left</strong>, turn the
car and then approach as above.</p>

<p>Down the track you go.</p>

<p>The final phase takes a bit over five minutes. Keep going straight!
  From time to time you'll see our house in the distance, above most
  other buildings in the valley. If it's after dark and we know you're
  coming we'll turn on lots of lights.</p>

<p><strong>Details:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><p>About 100m of rough earth track; some large stones so take it
  easy. After that it's all concreted.</p></li>

<li><p>At 0.6km there's a turn to the left which you <strong>do not
take</strong>. Our house is clearly visible ahead, above, and a bit to 
the  right. </p>

</li>

<li><p>At 1.0km there's a fork down and to the right which
  you <strong>do not take</strong>. Another 100m (1.1km from the
  start) the track bends left and (rough concrete at this point)
  climbs steeply. 1st gear!! At the top is a high wall covered with
  conifers, at the top you might just see the sign "La Finca San
  Antonio". Turn in to carpark and see if there's any parking spaces
  available.</p>
