<div align="center"><h1>Patching made easy - lisp wins again</h1>

  <h3>Nick Levine<br />Ravenbrook Limited</h3>
  <h6>(Occasional sponsors of mid-morning cookies at lisp conferences since 2009)</h6>
</div>

<p>This is a concatenation of the slides from
my <a href="http://www.international-lisp-conference.org/2009/lightning">lightning
talk</a> at
  <a href="http://www.international-lisp-conference.org/2009">ILC 2009</a></p>

<ul>

<li><p>This isn't going to be rocket science</p></li>

<li><p>Just the observation that lisp carries a lot of ordinary magic
    which can add significant value to the user</p></li>

<li><p>And here's an example: Lisp fasls make convenient patches for
end users</p></li>

<li><p>In my application each release comes with an empty "patches"
directory</p>

    <ul>

    <li><p>Sorry, no time now to tell you anything about this
    application...</p></li>

    <li><p>... except that it's released as a "level-0 delivered
	LispWorks application" &mdash; meaning it's all of Common Lisp
	apart from compile-file</p></li>

    <li><p>... and, though not relevant to this talk, it's a text
    processing engine</p></li>

    </ul>
</li>

<li><p>If the user drops fasls into that directory the application
will load them</p>

  <ul><li><p>... on startup - but that could be different</p></li></ul>
</li>

<li><p>Really simple to use</p></li>

<li><p>Nimble: 10k fasl with minimal QA vs 30M full installer for new
    release</p></li>

<li><p>If a fix comes from LispWorks support it's still a fasl and the
    same distribution procedure applies</p></li>

<li><p>Caveat: the simplicity of this system depends on trust. I
happen to trust this bunch of users not to shoot themselves.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>Here's (most of) the original patch loader.</p>

<pre>
(defun load-patches ()
  (when-let (patch-files (directory
			  (installation-pathname "patches/*.fsl")))
    ;;
    ;; stuff cut out here - see next slide
    ;;
    (dolist (patch patch-files)
      (load patch))))
</pre>

<p>Almost good enough &mdash; the above would have been something of a
blunt stick &mdash;</p>

<ul>
<li><p>it loads everything</p></li>
<li><p>in order over which one has no control</p></li>

</ul>

<p>Here's what I did about that (deployed and worked fine for first 30
  patches)</p>

<pre>
(defun load-patches ()
  (catch 'load-patches
    (when-let (patch-files (directory
                            (installation-pathname "patches/*.fsl")))
      (when-let (revoke (find-if (lambda (patch)
                                   (pathname-match-p patch "revoke"))
                                 patch-files))
        (setf patch-files (cons revoke (remove revoke patch-files))))
      (dolist (patch patch-files)
        (load patch)))))
</pre>

<p>Solution: choose a special name and if a file with that name is
  present load it first.</p>

<p>Note the catch tag.</p>

<p>I didn't know when I wrote this whether I'd ever need anything more
  sophisticated and if so what. When the time came, the above gave me
  sufficient control over loading order that more complex behaviour
  could be bootstrapped as a "revoke" patch &mdash; rewrite
  load-patches and call the new one instead.</p>

<p>Here's the current version:</p>

<pre>
(defun load-patches ()
  (let ((*redefinition-action* nil))
    (catch 'load-patches
      (macrolet ((fasl-file (name) (format () "~a.~a" name sys:*binary-file-type*)))
        (when-let (patch-files (directory (installation-pathname (fasl-file "patches/*"))))
          (setf patch-files
                (sort patch-files
                      (lambda (first second)
                        (or (pathname-match-p first (fasl-file "revoke"))
                            (and (pathname-match-p first (fasl-file "revoke-*"))
                                 (not (pathname-match-p second (fasl-file "revoke-*"))))))))
          (let ((all-revoked nil)
                (revoked-count 0)
                (loaded-count 0))
            (dolist (patch patch-files)
              (let ((enough-name (make-pathname :type nil
                                                :defaults (enough-installation-namestring patch))))
                (if (loop for revoked in all-revoked thereis (pathname-match-p patch revoked))
                    (progn
                      (log-message :debug "Revoking patch ~a" enough-name)
                      (incf revoked-count))
                  (let ((more-revoked (catch 'revoke-patches
                                        (log-message :debug "Loading patch ~a" enough-name)
                                        (load patch))))
                    (when (consp more-revoked)
                      (setf all-revoked (append more-revoked all-revoked)))
                    (incf loaded-count)))))
            (log-message :notice "Loaded ~d patch~@[~a~]~@[, revoked ~d~]."
                         loaded-count
                         (when (> loaded-count 1) "es")
                         (when (plusp revoked-count) revoked-count)))))))
</pre>

<p>And here's how you revoke a patch:</p>

<pre>
(in-package "PROFILER-PLUS")

;;               REVOKE-BUILD-GLOBAL-ENVIRONMENT.LISP
;;           Nick Levine, Ravenbrook Limited, 2008-10-21
;;
;;
;; The purpose of this document is to patch Profiler 6.0.0, revoking
;; patch build-global-environment.lisp
;;
;; This patch accompanies patch file build-global-environment-redux.lisp.


(throw 'revoke-patches
       '("build-global-environment"))

</pre>

<p>Why revoke?</p>

<ul>

<li><p>defect in original patch</p></li>

<li><p>when the user gets it they change their mind about what they wanted</p></li>

<li><p>two independent changes required to same definition</p></li>

</ul>
