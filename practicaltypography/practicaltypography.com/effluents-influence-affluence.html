<div class="content"><div id="doc"><topic class="small">Effluents influence affluence:<br/>The economics of a web-based book, year two</topic><p>This book has now com­pleted its sec­ond year on­line. Last year, in my <a href="economics-year-one.html">in­au­gural re­port,</a> I de­scribed the rev­enue sources for the book. One of my find­ings was that only a small frac­tion of read­ers—about one in 650—sup­ported the book with any kind of <span class="no-hyphens">payment.</span></p><p><quo>For year two, I set a goal of<dquo-push></dquo-push><dquo-pull> “</dquo-pull>get­ting more read­ers to pay small amounts—not be­cause it makes a big fi­nan­cial dif­fer­ence, but be­cause it in­stills a vir­tu­ous <span class="no-hyphens">habit.”</span></quo></p><p>Did it work? Sort of. Though rev­enue met my ex­pec­ta­tions, I had to re­vise my view of how traf­fic re­lates to <span class="no-hyphens">revenue.</span></p><div style="height:1.5em"></div><p>Go­ing into year two, I ex­pected rev­enue to drop. Why? Be­cause I ex­pected traf­fic to drop too. In year one, the book got a lot of good word-of-mouth be­cause it was new. For which I’m grate­ful. But you only get to be new once. The greater chal­lenge—as it is for au­thors of printed books—would be turn­ing the book into source of sus­tain­able, re­cur­ring rev­enue. (And not be­cause this is how you get rich in pub­lish­ing—rather, it’s how you have any chance of break­ing <span class="no-hyphens">even.)</span></p><p>How did I change the book to en­cour­age more di­rect pay­ments? Not as much as I could have, I con­cede. In <a href="how-to-pay-for-this-book.html" class="xref">how to pay for this book</a>, I re­duced the num­ber of sug­gested op­tions. I made it eas­ier to make a di­rect pay­ment with a credit <span class="no-hyphens">card.</span></p><p>But I didn’t do the thing I knew would be most ef­fec­tive: namely, load­ing up the rest of the book with links to the pay­ment page, along with in­ces­sant nag­ging and wheedling. <em>Have you paid yet? No you haven’t. Here’s how you pay. Click here. Hey, you’re not click­ing. Please click. Please please please. <span class="no-hyphens">PLEEEEEEEEAAAAA—</span></em></p><p>Why not? Be­cause it would have been eff­ing aw­ful. Like so much of the web in 2015. Haven’t you no­ticed? A cou­ple years ago, we saw the omi­nous cel­lu­lar mu­ta­tions—web­sites on tablets and phones were be­com­ing ads for <span class="no-hyphens">apps.</span></p><p><img src="images/econ-2-apps.jpg"/></p><p>Now, the can­cer has metas­ta­sized onto the desk­top. I’m not talk­ing about ban­ner ads—we clev­erly blocked those, of course. But the re­ward for our clev­er­ness has been a web that in­creas­ingly re­lies on wheedling, whin­ing, and nag­ging. The pariah popup win­dow of yore has been rein­vented as the home­page-hog­ging in­put form. Most com­monly, this nag­ging is a de­mand that we sign up for an email list (aka more nag­ging, di­rect to your in­box) or that we com­plete an ob­vi­ously un­nec­es­sary reg­is­tra­tion—which usu­ally im­plies join­ing an email list, which in turn means … <span class="no-hyphens">right.</span></p><p><img src="images/econ-2-sites.jpg"/></p><div class="subhead" id="the-work-and-the-terms"><a href="#the-work-and-the-terms">The work &amp; the terms</a></div><p>I say this not to gripe. I say this be­cause though I un­der­stand why this shift is ac­cel­er­at­ing—in short, be­cause the web is <a href="http://unitscale.com/mb/bomb-in-the-garden/">ter­ri­ble at mak­ing in­for­ma­tion ex­pen­sive</a>—it’s not a shift I want to be part <span class="no-hyphens">of.</span></p><p><quo><dquo-push></dquo-push><dquo-pull>“</dquo-pull>Be­cause you’re a sen­si­tive </quo><em>artiste</em> who con­sid­ers him­self above the com­mer­cial fray?” No. I do this for work. Mean­ing, it is in­her­ently a com­mer­cial <span class="no-hyphens">activity.</span></p><aside>An idea that plays a lead­ing role in <a href="billionaires-typewriter.html" class="xref">The bil­lion­aire’s type­writer</a>.</aside><p>Rather, be­cause every com­mer­cial artist—sen­si­tive or not—con­trols only two things: their work, and the terms un­der which their work is of­fered. By <em>terms</em><quo>, I mean con­sid­er­a­tions of pric­ing, con­text, tim­ing, au­di­ence, and so forth. Granted, it’s more fun to think about the work it­self. But the terms en­com­pass the harder, more con­se­quen­tial choices. Harder be­cause they of­ten re­quire say­ing<dquo-push></dquo-push><dquo-pull> “</dquo-pull>no” to things that are clearly in one’s short-term in­ter­est. More con­se­quen­tial be­cause they shape one’s long-term <span class="no-hyphens">interest.</span></quo></p><p>Part of why this book works is that it’s <em>not</em> pol­luted with nag­ging and wheedling. I specif­i­cally wanted it to be a calm oa­sis on the noisy web—a chance to re­dis­cover some­thing we like about printed books, which is the im­mer­sion and fo­cus that can be cre­ated by noth­ing but text and ty­pog­ra­phy. That part is not in­ci­den­tal; it’s <span class="no-hyphens">intrinsic.</span></p><p><quo>In fact, be­fore I set to work pub­lish­ing this book on­line, a book agent got me a very nice of­fer to turn this ma­te­r­ial into a pa­per­back for a name-brand pub­lisher. Tempted, I was. But when I asked whether I’d be al­lowed to de­sign it, her an­swer was swift.<dquo-push></dquo-push><dquo-pull> “</dquo-pull>Of course not,” she said.<dquo-push></dquo-push><dquo-pull> “</dquo-pull>Why would you think they’d let you do <span class="no-hyphens">that?”</span></quo></p><p>Oh, I don’t <span class="no-hyphens">know.</span></p><p>I walked away. The agent was flab­ber­gasted. To her, my job as an au­thor was to pro­duce a se­quence of words that other peo­ple would shep­herd to mar­ket. Per­haps if my topic were dif­fer­ent, that would be true. But a book about ty­pog­ra­phy nec­es­sar­ily in­volves show­ing, not just <span class="no-hyphens">telling.</span></p><p>So here we <span class="no-hyphens">are.</span></p><div class="subhead" id="direct-payments"><a href="#direct-payments">Direct payments</a></div><p>In year one, I col­lected 321 pay­ments to­tal­ing $3676. In year two, con­sis­tent with my re­duced ex­pec­ta­tions, I col­lected 244 pay­ments to­tal­ing $3030. Not bad. The 25% drop in trans­ac­tions was off­set by a higher pay­ment amount, so the gross rev­enue was only 18% <span class="no-hyphens">less.</span></p><p>Re­call from <a href="economics-year-one.html">last year’s re­port</a> that the av­er­age pa­per­back sells a to­tal of about 1000–3000 copies, with the au­thor get­ting about $2–3 per book. On that ba­sis, I can’t say I’m do­ing worse than I would’ve had I taken that pa­per­back <span class="no-hyphens">offer.</span></p><p>True—de­spite my ob­jec­tions to the nag­ging econ­omy, I’m sure I could’ve dis­cov­ered some sub­tle ways to in­duce more di­rect pay­ments, had I spent more time on the prob­lem. And some might say that my re­fusal to do so makes my web-pub­lish­ing ex­per­i­ment un­re­li­able. <span class="no-hyphens">Perhaps.</span></p><p>The rub, how­ever, is that de­vel­op­ing and test­ing these tech­niques is it­self ex­pen­sive. If I spent a month on this prob­lem and raised the an­nu­al­ized rate of pay­ment by 25%, that would be a solid im­prove­ment. It would also im­ply that I got paid $750 for a month of la­bor. Not so good. Whereas if I could raise the pay­ment rate by 300–500%, then the re­turn on a month of la­bor would be worth­while. But that kind of im­prove­ment would be lu­di­crously <span class="no-hyphens">unrealistic.</span></p><p>More­over, it would prove noth­ing gen­er­al­iz­able. I’m some­one who’s pretty de­cent at this web stuff. For a non-tech­ni­cally-minded au­thor, these chal­lenges would sim­ply be <span class="no-hyphens">insurmountable.</span></p><div class="subhead" id="font-sales"><a href="#font-sales">Font sales</a></div><p><quo>As was the case last year, what really pro­pelled this book fi­nan­cially were font sales. In year one, I es­ti­mated that 450 read­ers be­came font cus­tomers, and I as­signed a<dquo-push></dquo-push><dquo-pull> “</dquo-pull>re­fer­ral fee” of $25 to each of those trans­ac­tions, for im­puted rev­enue of <span class="no-hyphens">$11,250.</span></quo></p><p>For year two, I es­ti­mate that there were 325 font sales at­trib­ut­able to <em>Prac­ti­cal Ty­pog­ra­phy</em>, and by the same met­ric, im­puted rev­enue of $8,125. That rep­re­sents an 18% drop—the same as the per­cent­age drop in di­rect-pay­ment <span class="no-hyphens">revenue.</span></p><p>This, in turn, sug­gests that a con­sis­tent ra­tio might emerge be­tween the num­ber of read­ers in­ter­ested in pay­ing for the book vs. how much they want to spend. For two years run­ning, about 35% more read­ers were in­ter­ested in pay­ing $59–299 for a pack­age of fonts than $5–20 for a di­rect pay­ment for the book. (For that rea­son, if I were to spend a hy­po­thet­i­cal month im­prov­ing sales rates, it would make more sense to fo­cus on in­creas­ing sales of fonts, not di­rect <span class="no-hyphens">payments.)</span></p><div class="subhead" id="traffic"><a href="#traffic">Traffic</a></div><aside>My mar­ket­ing &amp; PR bud­get re­mained un­changed from year one—still <span class="no-hyphens">$0.</span></aside><p>The sur­prises arose with traf­fic. Re­call that I ex­pected sales to drop be­cause I ex­pected traf­fic to drop. And sales did drop. But traf­fic ac­tu­ally went <em>up</em>—from about 650,000 read­ers in year one to about 700,000 in year <span class="no-hyphens">two.</span></p><p>This was both good news and bad news. Good news in the sense that traf­fic ex­ceeded ex­pec­ta­tions. Bad news in the sense that the frac­tion of read­ers fi­nan­cially sup­port­ing the book de­creased—from the year-one ra­tio of 649 : 1 to an even weaker 1000 : 1 or <span class="no-hyphens">so.</span></p><aside>La­trines at Hadrian’s wall, built—to last—in the year <span class="no-hyphens">124.</span></aside><p><img src="images/hadrian.jpg"/></p><p>In the broad­est sense, we can say that more traf­fic is al­ways bet­ter than less. But be­yond that, we can sketch out two ba­sic <span class="no-hyphens">theories.</span></p><p>The first the­ory is that web traf­fic is like pan­ning for gold in a river. The river con­tains a cer­tain per­cent­age of gold by vol­ume. The longer you stay in the river, the more gold you’ll <span class="no-hyphens">find.</span></p><p>The sec­ond the­ory also holds that web traf­fic is like pan­ning for gold in a river. Oc­ca­sion­ally, a mas­sive sewer line bursts near the river, drench­ing you in a lot more liq­uid, but the same amount of gold. Now you have to stay longer in the river whether you want to or <span class="no-hyphens">not.</span></p><p>I’m com­ing around to the sec­ond <span class="no-hyphens">theory.</span></p><p>There have oc­ca­sion­ally been traf­fic flows that had a high ra­tio of pay­ing read­ers—<a href="http://kk.org/cooltools/">Cool Tools</a> comes to mind, as does <a href="http://daringfireball.net/">Dar­ing Fire­ball</a> (John Gru­ber, your next din­ner at <a href="http://mussoandfrank.com/">Musso &amp; Frank</a> will be my treat). But these are very much the <span class="no-hyphens">exception.</span></p><p>As a rule, quan­tity and qual­ity have a neg­a­tive cor­re­la­tion.

I have two guesses. One is that it’s like Red­dit for pro­gram­mers, but they can claim that us­ing it is work, not goof­ing off. My other guess, since it has no ads, is that it acts as Mr. <span class="no-hyphens">Graham’s</span> panop­ti­con into his com­mu­nity of in­ter­est, as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebro">Cere­bro</a> does for Prof. Xavier.
