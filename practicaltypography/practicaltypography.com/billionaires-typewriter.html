I can’t quib­ble with the de­tails of your piece. It’s true that Medium and I are op­posed to cer­tain ty­po­graphic short­cuts im­ported from the <span class="no-hyphens">typewriter.</span></p><p>But by the end, I re­al­ized I dis­agree deeply with Medium about the ethics of de­sign. And by ethics, I mean some­thing sim­ple: though Medium and I are both mak­ing tools for writ­ers, what I want for writ­ers and what Medium wants couldn’t be more dif­fer­ent. Medium may be avoid­ing what made the type­writer bad, but it’s also avoid­ing what made it good. Writ­ers who are tempted to use Medium—or sim­i­lar pub­lish­ing tools—should be con­scious of these <span class="no-hyphens">tradeoffs.</span></p><p>So, a few words about <span class="no-hyphens">that.</span></p><div style="height:1em"></div><p>For those who don’t in­ces­santly fol­low In­ter­net star­tups, <a href="http://medium.com/">Medium</a> is a blog­ging ser­vice run by one of the founders of Twit­ter, multi­bil­lion­aire <a href="https://medium.com/@ev">Evan Williams.</a> Though it owes much to blog­ging ser­vices of the past (in­clud­ing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blogger_(service)">Blog­ger,</a> also founded by Mr. Williams), Medium is ori­ented to­ward longer, less di­aris­tic <span class="no-hyphens">stories.</span></p><p>Medium also dif­fers from ear­lier blog­ging ser­vices in a sig­nif­i­cant, con­trar­ian way: it of­fers you, the writer, nearly zero op­tions for the pre­sen­ta­tion of your sto­ries. No mat­ter what kind of story you write, or who your read­ers are, it gets pack­aged into a sin­gle, non-ne­go­tiable <span class="no-hyphens">template.</span></p><p>Medium isn’t the only blog­ging ser­vice rid­ing this wave, though so far it seems to have the biggest surf­board.

Min­i­mal­ism doesn’t fore­close ei­ther ex­pres­sive breadth or con­cep­tual depth. On the con­trary, the min­i­mal­ist pro­gram—as it ini­tially emerged in fine art of the 20th cen­tury—has been about di­vert­ing the viewer’s at­ten­tion from overt signs of au­thor­ship to the deeper pu­rity of the <span class="no-hyphens">ingredients.</span></p><aside>Ad Rein­hardt with some of his amaz­ing <a href="http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/collections/collection-online/artwork/3698">black paint­ings.</a> (Spoiler alert: they’re not en­tirely <span class="no-hyphens">monochromatic.)</span></aside><p><img src="images/reinhardt.jpg"/></p><aside>Bryan Gar­ner notes that <em>ho­mo­ge­neous</em> is fre­quently mis­spelled <em>ho­moge­nous</em>, and has five syl­la­bles that are fre­quently mis­pro­nounced as four. (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Garners-Modern-American-Usage-Garner/dp/0195382757">GMAU 3rd ed.</a> at <span class="no-hyphens">425.)</span></aside><p>If that’s the case, we can’t say that Medium et al. are of­fer­ing min­i­mal­ist de­sign. Only the ve­neer is min­i­mal­ist. What they’re really of­fer­ing is a shift from de­sign as a choice to de­sign as a con­stant. In­stead of min­i­mal­ist de­sign, a bet­ter term might be <em>ho­mo­ge­neous</em> <span class="no-hyphens">design.</span></p><p>On the one hand, Medium’s ho­mo­ge­neous de­sign works and reads well. Mem­bers of Medium’s de­sign team have <a href="https://medium.com/designing-medium">cat­a­logued the many ty­po­graphic de­tails</a> they’ve im­ple­mented. Good for them. If they <a href="https://medium.com/@verbagetruck/dustin-senos-typesets-the-future-86fd91e9b6ee">some­times act</a> as if they dis­cov­ered ty­pog­ra­phy like it was the Higgs bo­son, we can for­give their ex­cess of en­thu­si­asm. Bring­ing these de­tails to a wider au­di­ence, and rais­ing stan­dards for ty­pog­ra­phy on the web gen­er­ally, is a wor­thy <span class="no-hyphens">project.</span></p><p>On the other hand, a nec­es­sary side ef­fect of Medium’s ho­mo­ge­neous de­sign is that every story looks the same. If you agree that the role of ty­pog­ra­phy is to en­hance the text for the ben­e­fit of the reader (as I con­tend in <a href="who-is-typography-for.html" class="xref">who is ty­pog­ra­phy for?</a>), then it stands to rea­son that dif­fer­ent texts de­mand dis­tinct ty­pog­ra­phy. As I say in <a href="what-is-good-typography.html" class="xref">What is Good Ty­pog­ra­phy?</a>, one size never fits all.

Among web-pub­lish­ing tools, I see Medium as the equiv­a­lent of a frozen pizza: not as whole­some as a meal you could make your­self, but for those with­out the time or mo­ti­va­tion to cook, a po­ten­tially bet­ter op­tion than just eat­ing peanut but­ter straight from the <span class="no-hyphens">jar.</span></p><aside><quo><dquo-push></dquo-push><dquo-pull>“</dquo-pull>You don’t need to see our for­mat­ting <span class="no-hyphens">options.”</span></quo></aside><p><img src="images/obi-wan.jpg"/></p><p>The prob­lem, how­ever, is that Medium holds out its ho­mo­ge­neous de­sign as more than a frozen pizza. It has be­come, by the Jedi mind trick­ery fa­vored by to­day’s tech com­pa­nies, a Bel­la­gio buf­fet of de­li­cious <span class="no-hyphens">nonsense:</span></p><ol><li><p>Evan Williams <a href="https://medium.com/about/what-were-trying-to-do-with-medium-e2f5bfcf0434">frames Medium</a><quo> as a<dquo-push></dquo-push><dquo-pull> “</dquo-pull>place for ideas” with an<dquo-push></dquo-push><dquo-pull> “</dquo-pull>ethos” of<dquo-push></dquo-push><dquo-pull> “</dquo-pull>open­ness and democ­racy—like the In­ter­net it­self.” Fine, but ide­al­is­tic plat­i­tudes ex­plain noth­ing. How, specif­i­cally, does Medium im­prove the <span class="no-hyphens">Internet?</span></quo></p></li><li><p>Mr. Williams <a href="https://medium.com/about/writing-in-medium-df8eac9f4a5e">claims</a><quo> that Medium is<dquo-push></dquo-push><dquo-pull> “</dquo-pull>the best writ­ing tool on the web.” Okay, that’s at least con­crete. But we’ve got a lot of good web-based writ­ing tools al­ready. Medium does more than <span class="no-hyphens">those?</span></quo></p></li><li><p>Ac­tu­ally, no—Mr. Williams <a href="https://medium.com/about/writing-in-medium-df8eac9f4a5e">con­cedes</a><quo> that Medium has<dquo-push></dquo-push><dquo-pull> “</dquo-pull>stripped out a lot of the power that other ed­i­tors give you.” So how is it pos­si­ble to be<dquo-push></dquo-push><dquo-pull> “</dquo-pull>the best” while of­fer­ing <span class="no-hyphens">less?</span></quo></p></li><li><p>Here, Mr. Williams <a href="https://medium.com/about/writing-in-medium-df8eac9f4a5e">par­ries</a><quo>—he claims that think­ing about the pre­sen­ta­tion of your work is<dquo-push></dquo-push><dquo-pull> “</dquo-pull>a ter­ri­ble dis­trac­tion and a waste of time.” <span class="no-hyphens">Why?</span></quo></p></li><li><p>Ap­par­ently <a href="https://medium.com/about/writing-in-medium-df8eac9f4a5e">be­cause he’s</a><quo><dquo-push></dquo-push><dquo-pull> “</dquo-pull>one of those peo­ple who will open up Word and spend half [his] time defin­ing styles and ad­just­ing the spac­ing be­tween para­graphs.” Hmm, not every­one has that prob­lem with <span class="no-hyphens">Word.</span></quo></p></li><li><p>Now comes the hand-wav­ing, as Mr. Williams as­sures us that Medium’s ho­mo­ge­neous de­sign isn’t a lim­i­ta­tion—it’s <a href="https://medium.com/about/writing-in-medium-df8eac9f4a5e">in fact es­sen­tial</a><quo> to let your<dquo-push></dquo-push><dquo-pull> “</dquo-pull>bril­liance and cre­ativ­ity flow smoothly onto the <span class="no-hyphens">screen.”</span></quo></p></li><li><p>More­over, any­one who dis­agrees <a href="https://medium.com/about/writing-in-medium-df8eac9f4a5e">is a Lud­dite</a><quo>—be­cause<dquo-push></dquo-push><dquo-pull> “</dquo-pull>every­thing [other than Medium] feels like step­ping back in <span class="no-hyphens">time.”</span></quo></p></li></ol><p>Like all non­sense, it’s in­tended to be easy to swal­low. But Mr. Williams’s ar­gu­ment is flawed in at least three <span class="no-hyphens">ways:</span></p><ol><li><p><strong>It makes no sense in the con­text of to­day’s web</strong>. If Medium had launched in 2005, it would’ve been as­ton­ish­ing. But it didn’t. To­day, the costs of web pub­lish­ing—in­clud­ing de­sign—have de­clined to al­most zero. Rel­a­tive to to­day’s web, Medium is not cre­at­ing new pos­si­bil­i­ties, but in­stead clos­ing them off. To pre­vail, Medium needs to per­suade you that you don’t care about the broader ex­pres­sive pos­si­bil­i­ties of web <span class="no-hyphens">publishing.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>It sets up a false di­chotomy about writ­ing tools</strong>. Mr. Williams de­picts the writer’s choice as Medium vs. com­pli­cated tools like Word. Not ac­cu­rate. First, dif­fer­ent tools ex­ist for dif­fer­ent needs. It would be silly to use Word to make a web page, but equally silly to use Medium to pre­pare a print-on-de­mand pa­per­back. Sec­ond, any­one who’s used cur­rent blog­ging tools ap­pre­ci­ates that web pub­lish­ing has be­come heav­ily au­to­mated. Much of the for­mat­ting can be han­dled au­to­mat­i­cally (e.g., via <a href="https://wordpress.org/themes/">Word­Press themes</a>) or man­u­ally, as you <span class="no-hyphens">prefer.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>You’re giv­ing up far more than de­sign choice</strong>. Mr. Williams <a href="https://medium.com/about/writing-in-medium-df8eac9f4a5e">de­scribes</a><quo> Medium’s key ben­e­fit as res­cu­ing writ­ers from the<dquo-push></dquo-push><dquo-pull> “</dquo-pull>ter­ri­ble dis­trac­tion” of for­mat­ting chores. But con­sider the cost. Though he’s bait­ing the hook with de­sign, he’s also ask­ing you, the writer, to let him con­trol how you of­fer your work to read­ers. Mean­ing, to get the full ben­e­fit of Medium’s de­sign, you have to let your story live on Medium, send all your read­ers to Medium, have your work per­ma­nently en­tan­gled with other sto­ries on Medium, and so on—a sig­nif­i­cant <span class="no-hyphens">concession.</span></quo></p></li></ol><p>As for that en­tan­gle­ment among sto­ries, Mr. Williams <a href="https://medium.com/@ev/sarah-lacys-latest-medium-me-critique-makes-no-sense-1917c67405ca">has con­ceded</a><quo> that it’s<dquo-push></dquo-push><dquo-pull> “</dquo-pull>con­fus­ing.” But this am­bi­gu­ity isn’t a bug. It’s an es­sen­tial fea­ture of the busi­ness plan. The goal is to cre­ate the il­lu­sion that every­thing on Medium be­longs to one ed­i­to­r­ial ecosys­tem, as if it were the </quo><em>New York Times</em>.</p><aside>No word yet on how Medium’s <a href="https://medium.com/policy/medium-privacy-policy-f03bf92035c9">sur­veil­lance poli­cies</a> square with all that open­ness and <span class="no-hyphens">democracy.</span></aside><p>But un­like the <em>Times</em>, Medium pays for <a href="https://medium.com/@ev/what-is-now-the-matter-at-medium-105a334f2ea">only a small frac­tion</a> of its sto­ries. The rest are sub­mit­ted—for free—by writ­ers like you. Af­ter a long time <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/08/what-is-medium/278965/">be­ing elu­sive</a> about its busi­ness model, Medium re­vealed that it plans to make money by—sur­prise!—<a href="http://adage.com/article/digital/bmw-runs-ads-medium-twitter-founders-platform/294321/">sell­ing ad­ver­tis­ing.</a> This means dis­play­ing ads, but also col­lect­ing and sell­ing data about read­ers and writ­ers. So Medium will ex­tract rev­enue from every story, whether it paid for that story or not. (By the way, will that rev­enue be shared with writ­ers? <a href="https://medium.com/inside/there-will-be-money-d80f7d0178a9">Um, no.</a>)</p><p>And com­ing full cir­cle—what’s the in­dis­pens­able tool for cre­at­ing this il­lu­sion of an ed­i­to­r­ial ecosys­tem? The ho­mo­ge­neous de­sign. The but­ter­fly bal­lot of 2000 (de­picted in <a href="why-typography-matters.html" class="xref">Why ty­pog­ra­phy mat­ters</a>) proved that er­rors of ty­pog­ra­phy can have his­toric con­se­quences. Medium proves that ty­pog­ra­phy can be used as a tool of eco­nomic lever­age and <span class="no-hyphens">control.</span></p><p><quo>In truth, Medium’s main prod­uct is not a pub­lish­ing plat­form, but the pro­mo­tion of a pub­lish­ing plat­form. This pro­mo­tion brings read­ers and writ­ers onto the site. This, in turn, gen­er­ates the us­age data that’s valu­able to ad­ver­tis­ers. Boiled down, Medium is sim­ply mar­ket­ing in the ser­vice of more mar­ket­ing. It is not a<dquo-push></dquo-push><dquo-pull> “</dquo-pull>place for ideas.” It is a place for ad­ver­tis­ers. It is, there­fore, ut­terly <span class="no-hyphens">superfluous.</span></quo></p><p><quo><dquo-push></dquo-push><dquo-pull>“</dquo-pull>But what about all the writ­ing on Medium?” The mea­sure of su­per­fluity is not the writ­ing on Medium. Rather, it’s what Medium </quo><em>adds</em> to the writ­ing. Re­call the ques­tion from above: how does Medium im­prove the In­ter­net? I haven’t seen a sin­gle story on Medium that couldn’t ex­ist equally well else­where. Nor ev­i­dence that Medium’s edit­ing and pub­lish­ing tools are a man­i­fest im­prove­ment over what you can do with other <span class="no-hyphens">tools.</span></p><p>In sum—still <span class="no-hyphens">superfluous.</span></p><div class="subhead" id="what-we-can-learn-from-typewriters"><a href="#what-we-can-learn-from-typewriters">What we can learn from typewriters</a></div><aside><img src="images/olivetti.jpg"/> Olivetti was fa­mous for its <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/19855494@N00/sets/72157603713300507/">graphic and ad­ver­tis­ing de­sign</a> as well as its <span class="no-hyphens">typewriters.</span></aside><p>Let’s re­mem­ber two points that get lost among the torches and pitch­forks car­ried by <a href="https://medium.com/designing-medium/death-to-typewriters-9b7712847639"><quo><dquo-push></dquo-push><dquo-pull>“</dquo-pull>Death to <span class="no-hyphens">Typewriters.”</span></quo></a></p><p>First, al­though the type­writer did im­pose ho­mo­ge­neous (and ugly) ty­pog­ra­phy, it had ex­cel­lent ethics. The type­writer made it pos­si­ble to write more quickly, leg­i­bly, and ac­cu­rately than ever be­fore, with low cost and high porta­bil­ity. In short, it of­fered free­dom. For that, ho­mo­ge­neous de­sign was a small price to <span class="no-hyphens">pay.</span></p><p>Sec­ond, though type­writer ty­pog­ra­phy was ter­ri­ble, it wasn’t a choice made by type­writer man­u­fac­tur­ers out of lazi­ness or ig­no­rance. These com­pro­mises were ne­ces­si­tated by the me­chan­i­cal lim­i­ta­tions of the type­writer. Type­writ­ers were never ideal, but as cer­tain lim­i­ta­tions were over­come, they got <span class="no-hyphens">better.</span></p><aside><quo>IBM in­vented the<dquo-push></dquo-push><dquo-pull> “</dquo-pull>type ball” tech­nol­ogy that made it pos­si­ble to use dif­fer­ent fonts in a type­writer.

We en­joy the ben­e­fits of the type­writer with­out any of its lim­i­ta­tions. We get more ef­fi­ciency, speed, stor­age, de­sign op­tions, and free­dom.

Tech­nol­ogy keeps im­prov­ing, thereby ex­pand­ing pos­si­bil­i­ties for us. So we have a choice. We can ei­ther ig­nore those pos­si­bil­i­ties, and merely ac­cept what tech­nol­ogy of­fers, which will ul­ti­mately make us lazy. Or we can ex­plore those new pos­si­bil­i­ties. But to do that, we need to ex­pect more of <span class="no-hyphens">ourselves.</span></p><p>We also need bet­ter tools. I’d char­ac­ter­ize most of my work as tool­smithing—whether the project is <a href="http://concoursefont.com/">de­sign­ing a font,</a> <a href="index.html">writ­ing a book,</a> or <a href="http://pollenpub.com/">cre­at­ing pub­lish­ing soft­ware.</a> I don’t con­trol how oth­ers use these tools. I don’t want to, ei­ther. For me, it’s far more in­ter­est­ing to share these tools and then be sur­prised by how oth­ers use <span class="no-hyphens">them.</span></p><p>To that end, I de­lib­er­ately avoid cre­at­ing tools that do too much. Some as­sem­bly is al­ways re­quired. For in­stance, I’ll tell you the qual­i­ties of good <a href="websites.html" class="xref">web­site</a> ty­pog­ra­phy, but I’m not go­ing to sell you a tem­plate. I want the cus­tomers for my tools to be re­spon­si­ble for some of the heavy lift­ing. That way, they dis­cover that what they get out of the tool has a con­nec­tion to what they put <span class="no-hyphens">in.</span></p><p>So even though I op­pose the <a href="typewriter-habits.html" class="xref">type­writer habits</a>, I still ap­pre­ci­ate that core ethic of the type­writer—re­mov­ing lim­i­ta­tions when you can, do­ing your best with them when you can’t. That’s a great idea. Yes, let’s ex­plore all the pos­si­bil­i­ties of the tech­nol­ogy avail­able to us. Let’s hack the hell out of every­thing and see what hap­pens. In the type­writer era, the tech­no­log­i­cal lim­i­ta­tions were mostly hard­ware. To­day, mostly soft­ware. But if we treat these lim­i­ta­tions as some­thing to obey—not over­come—we’ll just be­come in­den­tured to who­ever con­trols that <span class="no-hyphens">technology.</span></p><div class="subhead" id="what-we-can-learn-from-medium"><a href="#what-we-can-learn-from-medium">What we can learn from Medium</a></div><p>In <a href="https://medium.com/designing-medium/death-to-typewriters-9b7712847639"><quo><dquo-push></dquo-push><dquo-pull>“</dquo-pull>Death to Type­writ­ers,”</quo></a><quo> Medium in­sists that the type­writer is its<dquo-push></dquo-push><dquo-pull> “</dquo-pull>sworn en­emy.” In cer­tain ty­po­graphic de­tails, maybe so. But as a de­vice that im­poses ho­mo­ge­neous de­sign, Medium still has a lot in com­mon with the <span class="no-hyphens">typewriter.</span></quo></p><p>In fact, its ethics are ac­tu­ally <em>worse</em> than the tra­di­tional type­writer. Why? Be­cause Medium’s ho­mo­ge­neous de­sign has noth­ing to do with lim­i­ta­tions of the un­der­ly­ing tech­nol­ogy (in this case, the web). As dis­cussed above, it’s a de­lib­er­ate choice that lets Medium ex­tract value from the tal­ent and la­bor of <span class="no-hyphens">others.</span></p><p>Medium is a new kind of type­writer—the bil­lion­aire’s type­writer. It’s not the only bil­lion­aire’s type­writer. So is the Kin­dle. So is iBooks. So is Twit­ter. What dis­tin­guishes these new type­writ­ers is not the pos­si­bil­i­ties they make avail­able to writ­ers, but what they take <span class="no-hyphens">away.</span></p><p><strong>Whereas the tra­di­tional type­writer of­fered free­dom at the cost of de­sign, the bil­lion­aire’s type­writer of­fers con­ve­nience at the cost of <span class="no-hyphens">freedom.</span></strong></p><p>As a writer and tool­smith, I’ve found the rush to em­brace these sys­tems per­plex­ing. Not be­cause I’m cur­mud­geonly. Not be­cause I fail to un­der­stand that peo­ple, in­clud­ing writ­ers, en­joy things that are free and <span class="no-hyphens">convenient.</span></p><p><quo>Rather, be­cause gen­tle scrutiny re­veals that these sys­tems are pow­ered by a form of hu­man frack­ing. To get his frack­ing per­mit on your ter­ri­tory, Mr. Williams (the multi­bil­lion­aire) needs to per­suade you (the writer) that a key con­sid­er­a­tion in your work (namely, how &amp; where you of­fer it to read­ers) is a<dquo-push></dquo-push><dquo-pull> “</dquo-pull>waste of <span class="no-hyphens">time.”</span></quo></p><p>If you really be­lieve that, then by all means, keep us­ing the bil­lion­aire’s <span class="no-hyphens">typewriter.</span></p><div style="height:1em"></div><p>But if you have doubts, here’s a <span class="no-hyphens">counterproposal.</span></p><p>As a writer, the biggest po­ten­tial waste of your time is not ty­pog­ra­phy chores, but Medium it­self. Be­cause in re­turn for that snazzy de­sign, Medium needs you to re­lin­quish con­trol of how your work gets to <span class="no-hyphens">readers.</span></p><p><quo>Tempt­ing per­haps. But where does it lead? I fear that writ­ers who limit them­selves to pro­vid­ing<dquo-push></dquo-push><dquo-pull> “</dquo-pull>con­tent” for some­one else’s<dquo-push></dquo-push><dquo-pull> “</dquo-pull>branded plat­form” are go­ing to end up with as much lever­age as cows on a dairy farm.

If you need a plat­form for writ­ing, try <a href="http://pollenpub.com/">Pollen</a> (the sys­tem I made for this site), or <a href="http://wordpress.org/">Word­Press,</a> or a sub­scrip­tion ser­vice like <a href="http://atavist.com/">Atavist.</a> I pre­fer web pub­lish­ing de­spite <a href="economics-year-one.html">its short­com­ings,</a> but if you don’t, then make an e-book or PDF and dis­trib­ute it <span class="no-hyphens">yourself.</span></p><p><quo>As writ­ers, we don’t need com­pa­nies like Medium to tell us how to use the web.
