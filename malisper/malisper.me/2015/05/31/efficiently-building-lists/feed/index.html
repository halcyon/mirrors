		<description><![CDATA[Unfortunately, whether this is more efficient than cons + reverse or not depends on the garbage collector.  For a mark-sweep collector, this algorithm (traditionally called &quot;tconc&quot;, short for &quot;tail concatenation&quot;) is clearly better.  But with a modern copying garbage collector with an expensive write barrier when old-generation elements are made to point to new-generation ones, it may be much much worse.]]></description>
