		<description><![CDATA[These tutorials are fantastic! While there are great Common Lisp resources and documentation over the web, most of them are a bit harsh on beginners, not making the examples clear or concrete enough. These short examples and screencasts convey much more _useful_ information in such a small space.

And the page looks good too. It&#039;s unusual for Common Lisp tutorials to be so slick. Good job!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[(I use both CL and Clojure in web development. I prefer CL)

here is a business case: 30 years from now the Common Lisp code will still run as long as you use an ANSI compliant implementation. Common Lisp as a standard is frozen and won&#039;t be changing again ... if ever, which is a good thing.

In terms of web development using Common Lisp - it&#039;s tools and libraries are on par or more mature then Clojure tools or libraries. CL-WHO generates dynamic html5 (or any other html),  PARENSCRIPT generates javascript, as for web frameworks you have CAVEMAN2 and others.  DRAKMA handles http requests and such, CXML parses xml. If you need python wsgi or ruby rack - Clack provides that functionality for Common Lisp. If you  need fastCGI there is a Common lisp binding for that. And of course you can use any javascript libraries including AngularJS(or Angularjs2) or Jquery with PARENSCRIPT and CL-WHO.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[As someone who is currently using ruby everyday and learning clojure, this(and your other tutorials) makes me wish it was easier to make a business case to use common lisp in my industry (web development).

I suppose I can still do common lisp in my freetime...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I just purchased two other Lisp books through leanpub.  I think the materials in this series of blog posts would make a nice short epub (except that the animated images wouldn&#039;t work as nicely).  Anyhow... the point is... give me some way to pay for this.  :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Of all the tutorials/articles on Common Lisp conditions/restarts system this one IMHO is pretty easy to understand.

Thanks for explaining it from the point-of-view of throw/catch, makes one see the awesomeness of it.

Looking forward to read more of your articles.

Thank you for taking time to write them.]]></description>
