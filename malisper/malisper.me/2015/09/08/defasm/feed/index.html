		<description><![CDATA[What&#039;s this space in memory thing? And indirect ADC takes three bytes of source code, not 6. Is that the number of memory accesses? Three to fetch the opcode, two to fetch the address, one to fetch the data? How can the instruction take only two cycles when there are 6 cycles just to transfer data on the bus? Or is the total time the sum of those two quantities?

Or has memory usage something to do with an assembly-to-assembly JIT?

Also, not all 6502 variants have the same timing per instruction, do they? I thought that later variants had memory access as pure bottleneck, whereas earlier variants added a few cycles to that. Or is that what your numbers are?]]></description>
