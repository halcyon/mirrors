		<description><![CDATA[Hi, thank you for your articles and tutorials,

but I have a little problem, I followed your steps one after the others, however when I run the (sldb-restart-frame) command, after I add the break command and recompile the function, i get this error:


error in process filter: Bug: sldb-level is equal but condition differs
(arithmetic error DIVISION-BY-ZERO signalled
Operation was /, operands (1 0).    [Condition of type DIVISION-BY-ZERO] nil)
(break    [Condition of type SIMPLE-CONDITION] nil)


and then nothing happens

note that I am running latest sbcl version (1.2.14) and latest slime from melpa repo

thank you in advance for any help]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think I worked it out. In the above example, using fib.lisp, if you send the defun to Slime using eval-defun then the function definition is sent to the REPL. Assuming that the REPL has the correct debug optimizations, still no link between the function and the source is maintained. It&#039;s as if you&#039;d typed it in by hand, the reader macro expanded it to a lambda and that is what you get when you step through. No buffer association, hence to formatting either; it defaults to marking up the text with ***Here***. That&#039;s all different if you use SLIME&#039;s compile/load file feature. Then it knows about the buffer association and consequently marks up the source when stepping through.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yes that was my question. Alas I don&#039;t get this. I get the text label &quot;***HERE***&quot; ...and it&#039;s not the original source shown in your examples. Rather it&#039;s the macro expanded named lambda fib, so it&#039;s looking at a very different thing.


(SB-INT:NAMED-LAMBDA FIB
    (N)
  (BLOCK FIB
    (BREAK)
    (IF (&#060;= 0 N 1)
        (/ 1 0)
        (+ (FIB (#:***HERE*** (- N 1))) (FIB (- N 2))))))

		<description><![CDATA[After installing swank (part of slime), the first thing it does is compile. If you have the debug quality optimized for any reason, this will cause the problem you describe (it was optimized for me because I optimize it in my .sbclrc file). What you can do is make one edit to swank, such as deleting a whitespace character and just restart Slime. That should cause swank to recompile. Just make sure that you do not have debug optimized when you do that.]]></description>
