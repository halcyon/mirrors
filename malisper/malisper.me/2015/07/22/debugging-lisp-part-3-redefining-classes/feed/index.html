		<description><![CDATA[so presumably if i were to redefine the class again, update-instance-for-redefined-class will be called again, but this time it&#039;ll result in error, since x/y no longer there. is there a strategy for making update-instance-for-redefined-class version specific or at least redefine proof? i imagine explicit versioning is one way, and then a migration history for a class (we&#039;re assuming a very long running process here, that stores its data in memory)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[protip: when you have a defclass form then you can use M-x slime-inspect-definition while the pointer is inside it. This works for many things, not just defclass. There&#039;s no default binding, but I use C-c M-i]]></description>
