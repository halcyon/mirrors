		<description><![CDATA[Do you use lisp at work? I&#039;m convinced that lisp is the way to go for me as far as what language to use, but we have a set of &quot;official&quot;supported languages in my company that I will have trouble getting around. Any tips for this? Nice website btw]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I haven&#039;t written any clojure code and only a little bit of racket. Not enough to say anything about it as a language.

You say that you use vim so you first might want to look at slimv, the vim version of slime. If that doesn&#039;t work out and you still want to try emacs, you should use evil and see if that makes it easier to transition from vim to emacs. For writing common lisp in emacs I recommend the following plugins: smex, undo-tree, slime, paredit, auto-complete, and ac-slime.

I believe (but I&#039;m not sure why), that Ron Garret is developing a common lisp environment for beginners. You might want to contact him and see if he has any suggestions.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi - thanks for the high level articles.

Can I ask for some advice?
I had lisp in college years ago and want to get back to it instead of c...
But I have 2 issues - which lisp, and an efficient environment.
I like the stancard common lisp
but clojure seems to have much wider support - libraries etc.
racket looks like a nice complete package ide etc all setup - but can it be used for &#039;real&#039; programs.

I write data recovery software - lisp would be very powerful for that.
I have used vim forever... I have played with the slime, emacs setup but I get tired
of trying to climb the learning curve with emacs.

I just need to pick something and tackle it - so what environment do you recommend. It would be great if someone had a docker or vm that was all setup and you could just download it and start... I&#039;ll build one as soon as I figure out what to make.

thanks for your time.  I have some spare vm&#039;s on my cloud server - would that be of use to you?

Take Care
